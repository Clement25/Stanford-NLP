You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and you never have a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles, <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something you fell somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it like a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the tricky circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school, in the middle school in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom of children, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me go into the bathroom of the school room.
He was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations who fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
And I'm <unk> that we never got to know us.
You could be able to <unk> and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I should tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to tell you about please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and we take care of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> about another <unk> about a <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or break the ice vessels.
Each iceberg has their individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and hold it up to the end, while others can't get it more and <unk> in a <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, in large as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
And as a <unk> goes up, I'm breathing your atmosphere.
As an iceberg melts it releases water rich in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one following its way through the life cycle.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is an iceberg I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of frequent to come to you to actually witness an <unk> iceberg here.
You have it.
You can see the left one boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg in average size.
It goes out of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so he <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979 the same day, exactly at the same time, every single one -- a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to stay too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about understanding itself, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in an case, the chromosome was joined by the X <unk> of the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome from the sperm joins the X chromosome.
Both of them <unk> and it starts alive.
We'll go back to talking about them later.
In my activity of the ground to play two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am a <unk> of training and what I study in this case is the way people are disrupting the anatomy -- which are human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that I work in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on -- for example, with fraternal twins -- two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex -- individuals whose physical Science doesn't fit into male and male <unk>
In general lines we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> embraces many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having sex that are not <unk> in the common forms or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and tells the <unk> that we all have in <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body develops by a typically <unk> course.
When <unk> the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And so often, it's not until puberty, and developing the breast period, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
And after doing that, you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a Y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like the men, we have in the body called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands, produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like I -- I consider a <unk> woman, not knowing his structure, <unk> I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he had a life as a boy and just found out she had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th <unk> and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was the 19 years when he started to have the medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> which is, they have <unk> tissue, wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are lots of sex.
The reason why children with this kind of bodies is <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not to be able to have better physical health care.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- to be black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you have a body showing something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people inside the same body.
The highest highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in property of their sex in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called a lot of <unk> to ask, "What test are you going to do to determine whether to <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists who have no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we need to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> and <unk> are us who we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science is that the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we were thinking of were categories that are made directly into <unk> categories.
And not only in sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as it comes to the science of science, we get more and more into a awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in order of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very serious discussions today in the day -- <unk> not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is <unk>
And our ancestors never had to come up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put him into a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved down to not <unk>
If I stopped moving through it.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of actually determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
And I'm a liberal, I'm a liberal, I am passionate about people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I gets nervous.
And so I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought I was <unk>
It was from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the questions: <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find every time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is completely <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the Elder <unk>
The Elder <unk> were, for me, the first activists in the anatomy and explain why.
The thing that they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everybody remember, what we <unk> our beloved <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs from the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that the political power was coming to the right of blood being passed from grandfather to the father and then the son, and so on.
The promise, I got rejected that idea and replaced it for a new <unk> concept and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences -- that was very radical.
And in part of it they were doing because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there is very clear if you look at the story of the fortress that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being passed through a vague idea of a <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at, for example, the Declaration of 2007, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women were <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I am not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color people who were talking to the coincidence of <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should do anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years, you should have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things like that, at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, I love three months before time: June 1 of 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, he was born in term: was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact of being born three months before Mary were attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right to the sex consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different old age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, Henry, by virtue of being considered -- if you have not told them if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be a man -- it's now <unk> from the easiest person that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
I don't love the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that are still <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy would be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is sort of a kind of attitude to a <unk> "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people got caught up in a strange position.
For example: Texas has been decided to marry a man -- you don't have to have any chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have Y chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't make the examinations that they do to people.
But this is also very strange, given the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea is very good."
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should take care of this to people, because I have to admit that I know some of them <unk> that probably deserve social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sexual relations than people of 40 to meet.
So how do we put the theme of <unk> content.
It turns out so hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with <unk>
Do we really want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still leading this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed, unless they are willing to submit to an sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins <unk> to then pick them up, and then they <unk> his name.
But when the phone asked her the <unk> he was a very <unk> operation, said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people who are <unk> to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to finish that I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be democracy, or as it might be been, if we had gotten more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who I knew I was interested in in Feminism <unk> I considered a <unk> like <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unraveling the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, I think there are some female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the visitors were very excited to find the way to protect people in the state, you may have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we raise democracy beyond <unk> thinking less on the individual body, in terms of identity, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where every family wants to go live and work, have a chance to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily take it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just took off by buildings for apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already were owners, and the other half is still not stopping to do it.
You could try to increase the capacity by making <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around you have rules to avoid <unk> and the building distractions for construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, building a whole new apartment building, and always and when the rules of that place will build the construction instead of putting it <unk>
So I proposed that governments to put new reform zones to hold large reform and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later learned that roughly at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk>
Did you know that every year around 75,000 people will come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following election -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was her head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its <unk> ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, such as those rules that say that you can't go and bothered all the current apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said to me, <unk> the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than their <unk> cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms, which is a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that will <unk> the rules that are going to be there, and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which involves explaining that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport just covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that uses at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explains what a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the Afghan government would need help from <unk> countries -- they could benefit from the countries that would help them to establish and fulfill the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19 percent of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their constitution.
In a country that was just going through this hierarchical crisis, the voting in the Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All of them are <unk> all of the spots in society, <unk>
For <unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February has passed over again in a voting rather than a <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting in the <unk> at the age of 21, February, a <unk> for about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's building in Korea -- it's bigger than the Boston center.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting <unk>
The other thing is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and it would allow the <unk> to operate under an external legal system?
A country has been committed to allowing his Supreme Court to be the last of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> <unk> cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you have solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies who wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would go immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go and get a job work, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even the kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like in building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What it seems to be thinking about insist for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
So this is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that's that, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, smile, and more recently, photograph and post to my blog <unk> and colorful and different <unk> for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I will like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
And inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman walks at TED on clothes, and that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with a Sunday.
I call it tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> It took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be impossible to be a bad mood, when you are wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just do yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you would also stand up.
<unk> <unk> of the kid in the inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key thing.
If you think you're good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you're not good at something, probably it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inner and outside, you don't look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse to anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal fact six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is all going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I'm going to give up everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> to these things, because next to the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I go up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a depiction of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone that's completely logical.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists are going to need a lot of logic to solve these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see how <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed with the passage of the years is the one which says that one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born.
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking <unk>
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet you play a game with that parking lot, he taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to get them and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with a car bars, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find that they do all kinds of really rare things -- as they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years earlier, you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, you never saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why I shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just right in the center.
And then here we take a good approach to little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal little bit of metal, with a springboard and that runs supported by a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way that you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip of silicon -- and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum institution, but for that it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of awkward things, but then when other people go up and do those things, because I don't want to eat it, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> members of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal little to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive out all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
It would take the lights down, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air -- and then we went through it at a temperature of less than a degree by absolute zero.
Now, when it's just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free of acting as he wants to.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way she <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that you don't get to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In an case, all of the trillion atoms that make up that metal piece are still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means is that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little metal little bit of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you think?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that is talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it up, and we turned the lights on, and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear about a lot about that quantum mechanics says that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not quite true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that allowed me to do that.
It took me 18 months to me.
Lots of negotiations and stories are going to be done with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a bunch of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just on this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I didn't get married, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better that it shows you the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, at <unk> the art of New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move out there and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the overhead, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall,
You go forward. Which is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for instance, <unk> I think, about 10,000 billion pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get to 10,000 billion <unk>
So I'll show you what you really achieve with 10,000 billion pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people of the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is the <unk> which is to hit a Tuesday with a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get into even deeper and you'll see that you can actually get even to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see what you are.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is for coming, a second.
So we're very quickly going to jump over again at MoMA, in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The evening.
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what Van Gogh is, actually created this work <unk>
It goes up and true that we can do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk> night -- I think I'd never seen it as well before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have a <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same way.
You can online it can create your own museum to create their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function I call <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
This is about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, you send them to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even from the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital technology to do justice to its artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the big question I do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> or a pixel block.
In our lab we call it design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, all the children in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting in the year of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
There was some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, I would take a budget and you would put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what it is, in engineering, it was <unk> for real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today, what's interesting is that the control systems systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics and electronics
They're becoming active computers in the air.
And as <unk> they're starting to answer differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As one note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex but represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday lives.
This is from an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms to become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end of the hammer he took the hammer and he threw him back to the Moses -- you can still see a little dent in the <unk> and he said <unk> <unk>
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of taking the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the country.
Maybe some of the remember -- they were played by Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end I won in Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity is happening in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line is on the top.
So in the early evening there are people over here, and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call on the toilet.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yes!
That night everybody went to <unk> the center.
You see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
And then we put a little chip, one tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's lots of <unk>
But the other thing we believe is that if you look at every day that we <unk> it doesn't still be somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still goes away.
If we show it to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and a lot of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is push on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and the south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and you get the valves of <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels in water.
If the pixels dropped to the pixels on them, I'll show patterns, pattern images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, like you see in the image.
We presented this to the Mayor <unk>
It liked a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design the entrance to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There's no windows, but when you come up with it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the roof.
Or you can close the building and the whole architecture disappears like this.
There will always be somebody, in the winter, when you get the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost the whole architecture goes away.
Here it works.
You see the people who are going on in the inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night it was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact with it had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go, but a building that kept making cuts up and water holes and you had to jump out of it.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical column, the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, but in three dimensions, what changes is the light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can zoom in, and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the lights lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world's best dancing dancers today, the star of the New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left side, you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can turn the whole movement.
You can go all the way around.
And once we have the pixels to play with them, with the color and the movement, and the <unk> and the <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could all have a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what's remarkable that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is -- we can move from the digital world of the digital world, from networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered the pixel from the pixel of the pixel here.
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom -- to serve for sharing the major moments of the London Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of sky like something you can go up as a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or you might want to be in better ways, to be stronger -- to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and safe at ourselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe these people who were always wanted to be more creative.
What else is it that you ask them?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people ask creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who in addition to the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology, makes sense to the light of the <unk>
But if effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about others or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, the most interested in us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin protein that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize we all carry on the most bacteria more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> <unk> you ask him about <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully competent environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, dark, cold is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want to have no effort in their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional casual disruption of any rush to the output.
But by others, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would we get to the future?
We're in sort of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and only human life, a little bit of human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell is just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two <unk> cells.
But when <unk> organisms start to change.
It goes into the scene of sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body comes into evolution in the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to think that when I was a college student thinking, well, I was a college student to me, well, <unk> death for <unk> seemed quite reasonable at the time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas well in her 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a gorgeous dancer.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, George, I pick the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy.
I wanted to regain the health in disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move genome to the next <unk> adapting and generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as a hybrid rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level <unk> and then let us stop the sea.
I think that all of us <unk> the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily give longevity.
They don't necessarily serve the bigger or stronger or faster and even the most smart.
Evolution favors the better creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive to the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there to be there -- fish samples at the vacuum -- yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to phase <unk> I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning of reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and written from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, you know, <unk> <unk> and we become so much that we can't have the amount of isolation that we need to do for evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce a evolution of the traditional type, nature, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when a species <unk> <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, a sexy possibility and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you pick up in individual and family level.
Think about that if you could be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating the <unk>
Don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and he sued 13.
<unk> billion dollars.
The next year in 2004, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to about 20,000 and a week.
Not much for the fact that the human genome will actually make the human genome for <unk> and to be increasingly at the grasp of all.
You get those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin is able to make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce you against other viruses.
<unk> or no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu <unk> in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine something nice about the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
You can change the cells from their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the black egg -- and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating the diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same analytical technology, that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases are also going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a <unk> Ken <unk> especially if you could meet the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live in time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're going to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take a hundred thousand years ago, and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe happen in the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a more better society, more successful, more successful <unk>
Or, we're going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society which is more boring and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom they need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk with flight <unk>
So they immediately looked at it, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three minutes happened at the same time.
The pilot picks the airplane on the Hudson River.
Usually that's not the road.
It <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words I've heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight flying.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life was <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to do, and I did not did, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all of the experiences that I wanted to have and never implemented.
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while I was <unk> the George Washington bridge, which was not very much -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a great deal.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also turned to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I <unk> in things that didn't care about people I know matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have the reason -- <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Whoa! I'm not scared.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children to grow.
One month later, I was on a performance performance performance -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talents -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
And at that point, I understood those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and to live in another way.
You who are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be this -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that <unk> they still hope to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who <unk>
Thank you.
I have clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
And one day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, we have a total paralysis,
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation company, so obviously, graffiti is sort of <unk> and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they will draw with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I joined her brother and her father right there at that very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to turn it back again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your interior cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw about that and record negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sex organs -- then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, a lot of organization and so much move the things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of safety companies, and we got a machine to try and make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is great!"
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> world from every single corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, and I moved into the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and when they were born, they would have taken out the walls of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks old, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun glasses that we bought in <unk> <unk> Beach, a little copper wire phone wire and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera -- we put it up on an LED light, and there's now a device that's free -- and there's a <unk> -- we released one -- we released the software code, the software is down in a way for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company.
There is no hospital that can tell you.
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only his eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And then more than a year of planning, two weeks of planning on all night, Tony returned to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system.
We <unk> the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I was involved in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and she finally came up and get me back and get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our cry.
That's what keeps us in motion. <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential it deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
We've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> neither of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the most best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the Los Angeles center at the center of Los Angeles -- there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: If you look at something that is not possible -- do it possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at the moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I had never done anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and excited me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel that you need to do. If it's not now, if it's not now, if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years involved in situations generally very difficult and at the same time, a lot dangerous.
I went to the difficult <unk>
I worked on a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> zones and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in fact, in a part of my career I've been <unk> in situations as awful with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard about it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a chance into <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Facebook, a few on Twitter, I offered the rights to the name of 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes and according to content I would have been able to put in the face, especially if I put it into ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But this is a very good opportunity for you.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me, a year ago I could have been able to do it for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> <unk>
And as I said earlier, I stood in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be allowed to be done for something so difficult or as dangerous as to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, it has pictures of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes before the title, the brand <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were moving through the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure that we will take all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe I would give you a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you've ever met.
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film that you've ever <unk> the best drinking shots that you've ever <unk> from "The largest movie <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of the life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to do that <unk> the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the full idea -- all the shot from beginning to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to meeting them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big faces.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the film comes out and look like a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film to be me?
JK: So two things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I was going, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: And I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappear.
No wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, and make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the separate media scenario is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle worth of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this one.
Actually no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images at Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey Sergey -- No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president the president -- even <unk>
But all of a sudden when it's trying to make it really changes as well.
But why? Well, the transparency gives <unk>  like that rare bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
They took an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to businesses and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to <unk> <unk> story.
We want to take a story, but we want to make a story, <unk> story."
You see, when I was a kid, and my father would lie in a lie -- and he's looking at me at looking at the <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in history.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the mediate and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see is that what I started to see is that when you start talking to me -- is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, giant movies and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make large Hollywood movies say that the reason that their movies are so successful is because of brands are associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we going to compete with these big, giant movies <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically at <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm out there, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you pretty cool for this <unk>
You ready? You get a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the general look at that.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
They put into the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we're pretty much a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind us to remind people is why this is why we are interested.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you great.
How do you keep you cool more time? With better <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man in the street, to the people like me, <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: Get my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good good.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray and things like that.
Usually I wear sunglasses, like sunglasses, or I like <unk> and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: In part <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
I have <unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because they <unk> the <unk>
Man 5:
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand of Tom, but I often get stuck in the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If you could do it for them, you certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These people shape a way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which it comes to you, your friends, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come out and start in a place and start in my case, and they start in my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to why do you do that?
What is the <unk> In which phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You know, there has to be frightened. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS:
A: Thank you for your patience.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness on this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality of <unk> <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They got very good together.
And I think there's almost an paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only lie in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend -- and it's the nature of <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> against fear, those items, and you actually make them <unk> and make a good thing to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the Apple. Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
There are now <unk> and brands marks -- those things that have gone and come -- but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If somebody asks you to take your brand identity, your personality hands, what would that be?
You're an attribute <unk> You're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or you are a <unk> attribute of it.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of them are like being playful as being playful as <unk> contemporary -- or bold or bold or bold or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or, magical as <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
You're conscious, a sophisticated <unk>
You are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie how you use MRI to identify the centers of the desire both for commercial marketing so much for a movie film.
We went to San Paulo where they were forbidden in the <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are becoming the way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I have had the most answer or the ones I've been most successful is the ones I've interacted with directly directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took out their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies do not have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think of people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you gone? they would succeed.
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million of impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make lead.
And it's not wrong because it's almost all the agencies that we talk about to tell their customers not to be part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out of the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think that when you train your employees at the <unk> at risk is preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what it has to happen to us is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we need to give fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear -- <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today, a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends from <unk> who for <unk> and bought the rights of the name on <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to TED attendance next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we are able to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
<unk> boxes don't use <unk> software -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we can put a effective virus out of Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these boxes, gray, these control systems.
And that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they spent very weird things.
<unk> was <unk> as a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is actively searching in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is actually working in that place:
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a <unk> power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better take the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and grab the <unk> code, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs. A small and a big one.
We also saw that were very professionally armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So they know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for in the beginning was calls out of the system functions because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to get it out of the real world with real potential goals of the real world.
We need to be able to pass up or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent.
They don't find a number of thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
And I called them and I consulted them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly afford it, and even making it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go back to nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better than it.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code code.
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
That was not like this.
The results have been taken from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Still, we found that both digital <unk> would be only one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
And the small one is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I was really angry.
There's the gray box and the top box -- you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input values of sensors for example, from pressure sensors and the vibration of vibration and provides the chemical code, which is still running during attack, with false data <unk>
And believe it or not, these false <unk> data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds in <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital safety system.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbines is going on speed, you have to open escape from escape from a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator.
That's where we need digital safety systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is really important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have a <unk> to disseminate this load with a key <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
It makes as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what you're going to do -- it's a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the greatest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the implications, and better than we start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has become public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower, of this one.
There's one alone -- and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even higher.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give it <unk> skills or other than making a wheelchair users get up and walk back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that goes in in the morning, gives you a big force, which increases your speed, and help you, for example, how to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected it with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, you have to take on their back -- a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's being <unk> to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on their back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton exoskeleton -- I can put it 90 pounds for embodied land for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to get in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So now you look at the users of wheelchair users, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people and roughly, in the other world, in the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with a lot of very young people, with damage to the backbone that when their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We are also talking about the population that is aging going through quickly.
Their only option, a lot of times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- it's the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who had an injury in the <unk> column, and as a result he couldn't go back to walk at 19 years old, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got some sensors in it.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals into board computer on board on the back.
There are some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life, when, for a stranger jump in the air over the air down to the bottom of my life <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of <unk> <unk>
Shortly after a doctor, I entered my room at the hospital, and he said, <unk> never to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last breath of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the <unk> and even flying <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the future of future generations -- not just from soldiers, but how do I go to all the chairs of wheelchair from the wheels, everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Big Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know at their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living closest lives.
That means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this thing in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society where death is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been taken for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also putting into danger of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation makes you not fill in a stadium and the bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos can be heard of laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like <unk> apes -- love, not <unk> because they have frequent sex -- <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, I love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a child's play.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster the <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of the diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, of connections.
And when you see the game Bonobo sees the roots of themselves the same of the laughter, the dance and the <unk>
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> <unk> and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have a <unk> of <unk>
I just think that in this case I love him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as much in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because I think -- this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to think about it, this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that the Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a increasingly harder world with creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To be successful with success to a world that changes need to play.
But let's take the maximum game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate play, they can be the moments where the most urgent is.
So for that, listen, we need to embrace this gift of evolution and play together as they encourage creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain <unk> volunteers.
And in our city, where the volunteers are entitled to a highly skilled staff you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still, there was a race to other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that was definitely <unk> one of the worst days of her life.
We were at the end night, she was standing out in the rain, under a <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer he had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- first came to the captain and he asked her to walk and save the dog owner away.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of her life, I would have to tell the people who entered a call to save a <unk> just because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to <unk> I need the fire, and bring it to this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise that.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the firemen <unk> that at that height or less had finished off the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house, the treasures for the owner of the house, where, as he was expected, his treasure. received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of the owner of the <unk> the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at the other was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling by Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer fireman is witness <unk> and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also the acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or are there for <unk> remarkable levels of success, I would like to remind you this:
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, let's give it now.
They put food in a dining hall, a park park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the lives of someone but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, you come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I am a big fan of the block of concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, of concrete modules that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block of particular -- favorite in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly the same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked about each other to a world where everything was interactive.
And just like the concrete block the transistor allows you to create a much bigger circuit and more complex -- one brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved to the experts, so I decided to change it.
About eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about is that they're linked by magnets.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the rose and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue one with a green one, and very quickly you can begin to make higher circuits.
A blue with a green one is making light.
We can put a button on the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button through a pulse module.
<unk> this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures <unk>
To make it faster or slow to make it faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a <unk>
We want all the interactions in the world to move into building <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've had <unk> kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light work? You know, why the door in an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken <unk> to design schools.
So for example, designers without any expertise in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see here, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took the designers of the School of Rhode Island to Rhode Island, that they have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and said, Make something something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> cannon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all.
So <unk> has open code.
You can visit the website, download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for the environment to get involved in the environment.
collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I know that time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technical designers to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to do: we asked them to work on government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and would be like some <unk> <unk>
We took some members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send it to the wild world.
They worked big <unk> worked with <unk> employees worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would look at a quote, but what you really look for is that somebody to clean up when you get caught up in the snow because it knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get aid to this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we had a lot of last year.
They realized that the city has never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do, somebody can <unk>
I mean, has a component changes.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible for <unk> systems to see this application realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to make <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> but the people <unk> the batteries.
That's why he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just came out of <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So we now know about nine cities that are using, using it.
And this has spread without <unk> organic and natural.
If you know a little government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
And the acquisition of software is usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that the normal waterways would have taken at least two and 25 million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the law of California that even the time over 2,000 dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there's projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that comes to a couple of days and it spreads in viral shape is a kind of a shot of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the better government ways to work, not like in private businesses, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the issue of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we are very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
You haven't been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they don't have a <unk>
And these people know something that we lost in sight.
And it is that if we stop side to the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that take us nuts, the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we alone don't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy is not <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately made by -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking to affect the way of making change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, about <unk>
This is the health care center, of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He checked into the official knowledge base.
I didn't find nothing. It started with animal control.
And then finally, he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and putting it very strong music and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston does not have a phone center.
It has a <unk> website called <unk> <unk>
Don't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York City <unk>
And one day, this really happened to come this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, saw a neighbor.
And the next report said, "I approached the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So, a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role.
He connected the two people.
And it could have connected with government services to be necessary but neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
And when one neighbor helps another one, you sell the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a political <unk> Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government to embrace our values and we need to adjust our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of <unk> shallow <unk>
That's why we call it <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps us in love that belongs to us as something that we funded as something that has been operating against us, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> of the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have been faced with government, it's time to ask us what we want to leave with our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we can go to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible for root to root the government function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members of our members is 28 years old, so I <unk> I'm a generation generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everybody will talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time, and they do.
So when you face the government problem they don't care much about how to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring the work to the work to program applications that make the government better work.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by <unk> dumping a garbage cube that has a trash inside.
Of course, we were always able to clean those <unk> and lots of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you here, when it comes to the things that we need to do together, all of us will be a swarm of voices, or we'll also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in developing communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED seeing and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make sense, but if they teach it with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an <unk> family by a <unk> that was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia Virginia
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery to <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at it, she was approaching me and give me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then let me go.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> he came up and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I went back again and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him, and she looked at him, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on, <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
And he took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to give me three things -- <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to ask me is that you're always going to do the right thing -- although the right thing is going to be.
I thought I was like, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, and I have a brother a little older and sister a year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package and I don't know where the <unk> got us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just came up with <unk> <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing that we do.
And I took something, your sister also.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I got the look at the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, I'm still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading a lot.
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this thinking it's a <unk> I mean it because of the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should be <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
There were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or poor people are so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> cities all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all the color young people in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that comes to you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is <unk>
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and the fury of us will believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We are looking at our work some very curious.
In my state in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years, the level of loss loss is going to be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country of the world where it was sentence for 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, no possibility of getting away.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've been able to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty is defined by mistake.
Out of nine people who are <unk> has identified one that is innocent and released from the death row.
A rate of mistake, was an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation would never allow you to fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about history <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about <unk>
The terror threat is what they defined their lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and tell me, "Mr. Stevenson, you say <unk> <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history, we deal with terrorism, after the first time.
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
It was about terrorism, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we walk around with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that it could not be overcome <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, before the genocide we had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know what, it's good disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room was in silence and a lady said, "There is no way in our history, we can ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> would put us to run people.
<unk> about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, will react to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
Yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these things so hard, the positive things and wonderful are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the abuse, the <unk>
In my opinion, you need to integrate both of them.
Clearly, we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more <unk> with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
So thinking about them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
We are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
By innovation, with creativity. The development is not just the brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also for the <unk>
This connection to the heart is what drives us to look at not just how brilliant and <unk> but it's also dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for spirit, will be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, you must have <unk>
There's no more related disconnect with technology and design, that allowed us to truly be human because we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to remind you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we do these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a young man, to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> I call me -- to say, <unk> comes the <unk> We are going to get them to speak.
Do you want to come and get it.
I was like, "Be lady. Yes I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I gave him <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been paid <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech, and I looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At the moment, Ms. <unk> <unk> her finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> not to judge our technology, by our designs, for our design or rational.
By the end of the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich and <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, they prescribe them.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really deep issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much power.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge to turn someone in what it doesn't is?
The judge is <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
One night very late I was awake -- my God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't say you should have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14-year-old customer -- a little, black <unk>
I started to work on <unk> with a <unk> which said, <unk> for my <unk> black customer is treated as a privileged white of 75 years, executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethics, but the whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream -- or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had <unk> but he was sent to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to the court for this case.
I got into the car, and I was truly <unk>
I went into the board to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car. He walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a <unk> black man -- was the University <unk>
When he saw me, she came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. I said yes.
And so I approached it and I was hooked.
And I was telling me to tell me.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
And that was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the room for audiences.
When the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. I went <unk> and we started head-tail-head on.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The police prosecutors -- the prosecutors all over the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, because we were talking about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I reached the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look through the window and try and hear all that <unk>
It was walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man, <unk> <unk> entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant. I showed you, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black man stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> room to tell this young man to keep her sight in the goal with <unk>
I have come here today to TED because I think many of you that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to the other.
That our visions of technology, entertainment and creativity has to be brought to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your sight in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your senses, to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities for you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to <unk> the funds that are spent today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of the homicide of homicide didn't <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't come to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that the law is going to come up to make the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this is dramatic increase in the industrialized population.
And we let us get through the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to supply chain to rob a bicycle, by small crimes against property, rather than making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got <unk> <unk> here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses our senses are receiving much more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And like nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning <unk> the secret detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could be made to hurt us.
And so of course, a <unk> of stories will look at the negative.
That old saying from <unk> "If there's blood blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news to give us the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to bad at worse.
But maybe it won't.
Perhaps instead, what happens is we got <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces are <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction extinction -- water shortage, and we have no doubts about it.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems, and in the long time, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average per capita income per capita has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world literacy went from 25 to more than 80 to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to find out more and higher expectations.
In fact, they will define the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, so much of the people living under the poverty line have electricity, no toilets, no television, mobile eggs, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> of the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of this technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
So the reason that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that's -- in good times, in the war and peace, in recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the speed of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on one law on the left, it's curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computer in the cloud, which my friends in <unk> call infinite computing and networks, and its ability to democratize personalized production and its ability to democratize personalized production around the planet, synthetic biology, the fuel and the food, the digital medicine and the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory at Watson, on <unk>
It was spade.
I looked for the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this:
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all over the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have a absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
This is about taking a little bit of taking it out and make it off.
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
They took dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon <unk> with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal <unk>
It's tethered to oxygen and <unk>
But then he came up with it, and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on an Earth-like planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk>
It's not about lean but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the computer-generated generated versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study which shows that by the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk now about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan had pointed to the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after the country <unk>
<unk> a photo <unk> How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology that's available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to prove your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small fridge of a little bit.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any water <unk> saltwater, water, <unk> <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke has just thought to do an important test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola and <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an extraordinary innovation, by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communication in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan about 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart cell phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that the president is 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have ever happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video -- images, images, images of books and music technology -- <unk> diagnostic technology -- now they are <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to come up with the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device with which they talk, and because it has <unk> you can <unk> you can raise blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a medical medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the load of <unk> is 25 percent of the way there are <unk> health workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion of the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just passed the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health care.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> that to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What <unk> What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we'll have the greatest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars <unk> in the global economy.
And health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of <unk> and because of using impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy men and <unk>
How about some voices never had to <unk>
What if we give them to the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What did these 3,000 billion.
And if they are contributions we cannot <unk>
One thing I learned with the Nobel Prize is that small teams guided by their passion with one of them of course, can do things -- things that could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
<unk> shapes the structure and the functionality.
It's something very important for medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up, and they started <unk>
And it's been shown to be shown today the machinery of human patterns is better -- protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> passion for <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are happening to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very scary idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, you will give them three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that they were <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it very much to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The <unk> still say they follow <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a Lagos in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The Lagos was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 centimeter <unk> <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made more than average in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later the amount of fish had dropped in half.
<unk> to the five inches.
And you have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was meant to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad -- he called <unk> four.
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in the south of the South China Sea, and above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny <unk> remains that are <unk>
In short, the sea bottom came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background happens to be a soft break of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a living one.
He was still not <unk>
So they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are collected every time that we have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
We didn't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
I would start to start the start of starting to start -- new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have biodiversity, biodiversity, terms of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation using the images to use in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and we extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they didn't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the piece of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in a big extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies -- they kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose animals as well.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
So over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> which was very different.
And they will do because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them were <unk> like captain such as a captain and just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used, and they usually don't use the scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in their societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From the enormous role that can be a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area and can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle age people, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema maybe can fill in the vacuum.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why would you deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, it's been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is Cameron, to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the cable trends of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional fashion.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why videos are made of viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed to be a very, very difficult thing to do.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
You can see them famous on the Internet in a <unk>
There were over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage is receiving infinite amounts of views, and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Why?
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this filmed video outside his home in the National Park, National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows you in the northern rise of last summer.
<unk> was not saying to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I <unk> the <unk>
The creators of <unk> as Jimmy <unk> is presented with new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, at Friday.   Everybody wants to get a Friday.   Everyone wants to come up the weekend --   <unk> Friday. Come on Friday.  KA: You won't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> de Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows how often we use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of creators embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody of each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an extraordinary animation with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there's cats that saw other cats will see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone did an old version of it.
And then it was done well.
Suddenly, it came up a whole community of <unk> that made it happen to be a dumb joke at something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What script could you have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video will go up two days a minute, just the only thing and unexpected can tell you how these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who is protest against <unk> to <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't care too much.
Casey <unk> I'm going to be <unk> by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that prevent you from properly <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise to the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> has been able to do five million people to see and understand the idea.
So this approach is worth of everything new we make a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators are creative and creative communities of participation, the fully unexpected, are features of a new kind of media culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity as well.
As I said before, one of the actual celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't give me permission to express your ideas.
Now we are all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just the current media -- but they will celebrate the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only one unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
You know, for so much my words, I would now take it away.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to <unk> but I did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined to be applied to the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And then after a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat slid into the icy sea of <unk> vessel.
All adults knew about risk.
The greatest fear was the markets and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we took off, we would first take it out, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and vast vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of the men on our boat, or the engine and not being able to start out for six hours.
But I know the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, end the journey was too much to get it, and the first apple that I did, given for the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor of flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp -- <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to form a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> whose population is a <unk> of immigrant people.
Unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The odor that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English, <unk> among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, and then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT in <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what it should be <unk> which was generally <unk> they was always <unk>
Two pairs of school for school, one to hide with each other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were very rare and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was compiling and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were tracking about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares started to be <unk>
She opened a computer shop and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> mad transition and <unk> and <unk> boys were trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classic student with what I would enjoy myself.
On the other one, it was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> for violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many given help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer they picked me the youngest of the year.
And I went <unk> of a piece of puzzle to another, but the edges didn't exist.
So <unk> resident anonymously in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose lives had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the routines. and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a mother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we get into the boat.
No one had been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What don't you be <unk>
So I spoke about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly talking, the more I was able to talk about it.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were living in the edge of the possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a little bit at the scene -- and not only is it right, but it's something that you're grateful, maybe a gift of ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be, but not the way we fear it.
They had not been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I went to a small group of people for whom the slogan cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant soup of soup that all <unk>
They took place to entry at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant and we open ourselves up.
It made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and adventure <unk>
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had no changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
The 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of her husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't prove it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the <unk> hotel when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw me standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a few minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and said that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have it <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life actually put us together, we can now see that the men who would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have been very easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that for you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, a brave <unk> in every wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantees anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them safe, I will.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here, in the fourth or <unk> row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and take the sky.
We do it with airplanes.
At that time, when <unk> the great Indian warrior prince was <unk> he pulled a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the machinery to the magic.
And that was very excited to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I gave myself this idea of losing the ability to lose and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to enable magic, not <unk>
And my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was to my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling of the mobile <unk> the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it from <unk>
We love our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where are we here?
<unk> the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do is that?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character in the book.
In a number of times it comes to me -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl gets excited.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons, but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that children's children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned to me so exciting.
So over here, we need to tilt the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, they light your way in what it subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all fantasy book has always been maps but it's been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and every contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts from the <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk>
So we're bringing them back into a children's child story.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out on the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
And I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to recover this period of childhood you have to go out and in an chapter, we would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the variants of connecting between magic, Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and on and through it and through augmented really augmented -- you see a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inside plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We go towards a world where the forces of nature will be associated with technology and magic and technology come closer to each other.
It enhances the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that <unk> joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob on and up.
Every morning I woke up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that it needs to be <unk> or some urgency to that style -- but see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I got up my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were wandering around from their homes, to take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, come back to control and being captains of its own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the attention of the attention of attention -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video.
We all have shipping controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> ATMs in <unk>
And where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves life right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public -- you see a <unk> please be <unk> where, and when it's open, they already open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cellphone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce you to, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but as a <unk>
And we want to take a global level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that they help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in its place.
Please forgive me, and not just improve the health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they are photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photography was awakened to my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
He mixed with my previous passion by the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was on the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
I felt like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
You know, <unk> like this: a very <unk> road <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful but with the common goal of keeping the flu level.
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in a way like photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's more about capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it sound real.
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is your perspective.
But in the end, it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a slippery surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way you can create something that seems to be <unk> as though that was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's get into the brain because the brain doesn't support the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they are those ones that don't even have the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when we combine pictures is very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to look wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will keep making realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures should have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect disability.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that is very easy to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured by a fishing trip.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, even red -- the house of the top of the island for it to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome of an realistic outcome that we need planning to do.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures -- the result can be very beautiful and in a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please be able to <unk>
This is a diagram any one that I took out of a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many of us that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
So here's something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
<unk> more intensity because I wrote on paper.
Why do we make technology curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would look kind of ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve that would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives us a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport transport itself as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is unprecedented in the history of technological development of technological growth, which every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it will be converted into a typical <unk> I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we'd be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, "What is that new way you adopt the world?
So what new state is the world going.
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we are engaged in it.
I remember a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
And we can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and <unk>
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about two and a half billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that would be <unk> around it.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals organized -- we give them an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is, at the time, there was some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those droplets of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate outside of the outside and the drops grew of them.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you become <unk> they will take a distribution of chemicals that were <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time to bring chemical chemicals together, <unk> more, more chemicals and <unk> more.
They were usually more <unk> they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, life -- very simple -- but things become interesting when these drops <unk> learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways that we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to store information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> dust that I try to hide the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and it would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years ago.
But then the other big step occurred in which things would be very different -- and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming these cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and they <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's lots of resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate.
This communication took place that you would form communities that, in a way, they were put together in it, and set up a <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> together, or whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community would become more and more <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have communities, communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart or the muscles of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make more than process information in community.
It's <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the evolutionary time.
So a organism could, for example, learn to not eat a certain fruit because I knew the last time ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism because they had previously built these information processing structures that for evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures involves the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could be confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But of course, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the more <unk> version of the human language we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a very vague idea, <unk> on your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated to turn it into sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now lets us start as a living organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now go through periods of similar periods to the <unk> organisms, our <unk> methods and information processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
So the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that I told you by brought to a billion years of each other.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> the language, they took less than a million years.
And the further, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates their own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see at this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> wouldn't be possible without recent media.
But now design objects such that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we thought about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that something that you couldn't possibly could, it gets far further and faster than it never before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these random instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those who are more concerned about what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to figure out numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them made it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
Let's get those and <unk> the rest.
And now we are going to think of the best <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the children would take the properties of both of both programs.
So we got a new generation of software combinations that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
It <unk> some mutations here.
And it tries again and try again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are using very absolutely perfect <unk>
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're very weird programs.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
Once I was in a 747 in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer an <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
And so we started to rely on computers to make different design processes to do well.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make a lot quicker and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part of thinking that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I get stuck.
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up some of my fake <unk>
Before I was trying to deal with the theme of my talk, I talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Wide <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because it's going to be <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who tries to deal with the first base -- not come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who was 10 <unk> I hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player to the Women's League of <unk> on a lot of 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon which has also a number of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place and a dear to be dear to have two arteries <unk> and his family doctor derives from a cardiologist to <unk> <unk>
But you know what?
She's going to get too much better?
And its hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll tell you about it.
What do you think you should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a <unk>
What we do, though, is sending me into the world, and I would sit down with the <unk>
I never, would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I would take when I was in medical school.
I was a obsessional <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was studied to a blood test.
Such thing.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the nurses of nurses General Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything from memory.
My class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> of the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> the diagnosis of frequent differential and <unk>
And I even knew the difference of <unk> about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very right; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the medical school with the impression that if I did everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible thing to do it close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto, when they brought to the emergency service to the emergency service where I worked on.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I fled to a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist to go to the patient.
And they report the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are filling up with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on her heart.
I gave them <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I didn't do what I should have done, which was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to deliver <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to be a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even touching my boss.
The second one I made was worse.
When I send it to her house, I didn't recognize a voice on my inner voice that would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse to <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high and the ambulance together with the ambulance they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad deal in the stomach, I had <unk>
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went through to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was in order to go home. At that time I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did something I
It went through the emergency service service to home.
And there another nurse, not the guy who <unk> from the lady <unk> before, but another one -- he said that three words that most of the emergency doctors were <unk>
Other specialists are afraid as well, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
He remembers of the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
At an hour of having come to her house, after I would give her the high school, they had a collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> brought the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock of severe.
I would just breathe and was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all of their resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> until the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I was waiting for all hope that he would get.
And in the two or three days the next few days was clear that I never <unk>
It had a permanent <unk> damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days or nine days, they were going to be happening.
And in ninth day, they left them to go, <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the next few weeks later, I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and sat alone -- <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't touch it with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt did.
And it wasn't by my <unk> He was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would take things out and made sure that I didn't care about.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why he sent her home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Shortly that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, he opened up the sky and finally went out and I wondered if I felt better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I would bring the efforts to be perfect for not making more errors, I would do stopping those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work on.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a north department of Toronto, and I got a man 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little <unk>
He pulled him out of penicillin, and he sent him home.
But as he ran to the door was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my chief asked to speak to me in his office.
And he made the three words, you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
And he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, it's the top, but it can cause the close edge of those tracks.
him, fortunately, she didn't die.
You know, antibiotics and <unk> antibiotics and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same time of shame and <unk> then <unk> and returned to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were sent to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
It turns out an X-ray X-ray but it turned out normal -- a colleague who was checking the patient would have some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He made liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and to notice a certain sensitivity in the bottom right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon.
They were both operated and they recovered well.
But every single case, I <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what's really going on, how can you share this with my <unk>
How do I show this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party, you'll hear about mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe it would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there is two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep, and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you go from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism -- I've done a personal study of medical litigation and medical failures to learn how possible, from the first item I wrote for the "Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every single day, where one in 10 drugs are going to be wrong, or the <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> eliciting chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian for medical mistakes.
<unk> U.S. Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going through every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep is <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in my chest, and it comes out with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and suddenly my story <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the same way.
And my patients are not cars -- they didn't prevent their symptoms always in the same way.
All this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all professional professionals -- well, they will be no one.
And with respect to people who don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white <unk> is a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say this is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students would be <unk> <unk> down my head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, you know human knows human -- they accept it, and they won't be proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
It will take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and to support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk>
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day to do it.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently I did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of elections that says to pick an average American -- are about 70 a day.
Not a lot of research followed for a week to a group of CEOs from companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> for these executives and the time that we <unk> to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, you know, <unk> <unk> labor per week.
Naturally, every job involved a lot of <unk>
Half of those choices took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many they belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do they grade the way that we manage those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the drug <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 percent <unk> and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why did I never buy anything?
This is a shelf for <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in box <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked her, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists which come every day, usually with his cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment. This is the <unk>
That's hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
I put a post for <unk> right at the shop.
We put out there <unk> of six <unk> or 24 tastes different and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop stopping <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent, when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
You stopped when there were only three percent of us to buy <unk>
From the ones that stood up when he was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> We probably <unk> -- less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices affects us in a good decision <unk>
We decided to not decide, even though this doesn't get us.
Now the issue of day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for retirement savings about a million Americans, from about 650 plans to this country.
We were interested in looking at the number of money that was available for savings plans.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had plans that were going from two, to 59 different choices.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, there were fewer participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that was offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for the ones they decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choice, more people would benefit from avoiding actions or funds of investment.
The more choices, there were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that are going to try to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is to make the decision, that <unk> even when this is against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
There are more likely to pick things less <unk> although objectively they go better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that enormous variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, to contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
So today I want to give you a four simple techniques that we've gone through in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of the bizarre choices, there will be an increase in sales, it will be costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw 10 percent in sales.
When the corporation Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that are less likely to become <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and under costs.
You know that retail today is to offer 45,000 products.
In a bus store we are offered about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come up on how to manage the best choices is by David <unk> the <unk> program.
All employees at Harvard are <unk> automatically to a safe <unk>
The people who want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know that people often say, "I don't know how you are."
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those choices.
And if your employees can't <unk> they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer the people in this audience a few vacation with all the paid road to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give them a applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> All right. Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first trial, which in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the overload of choices, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences need to feel very very specific <unk>
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when it uses card cards or credit that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that you can see more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being treated by a <unk> plan.
So to that meeting, we were going to look at exactly how it was <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that you would ask the staff who would think about the positive things that they would spend in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in <unk> of 20 and an increase in the number that were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories more than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a corridor of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarket.
But, you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> exhibitions here.
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This scheme is totally useless.
The categories should indicate something to you who <unk> not to be <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
I suspect who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think of, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision in buying a car.
This is a car German manufacturer that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
It's 56 other outside of the car.
You know, <unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order of the order of the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from lots of choices, 56 color at all times, four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you give up, always the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to few times, <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, you keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information is presented.
If we start with it, you learn to <unk>
Although the pick box doesn't tell you anything about the preferences of <unk> in all ways, you kind of <unk> us.
We are excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternate alternatives -- to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help <unk> <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people to work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful being in our choices are better to be able to do the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East East Germany, if you had a computer typewriter I had to test the government.
I had to record a picture of example written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this will solve the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a little printed dots on every page that follow a pattern that makes them get away from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what's happening in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are we <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The <unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, large amounts.
There are really many cases of online <unk> <unk> that we would share money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by stealing money from our bills when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy some of our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account -- millions of dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely any of us to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, motivate them to motivate them to motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a huge role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the criminals like Anonymous that do it to protest and the last group are the national <unk> the governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority on the Netherlands -- or, actually, it was.
<unk> the failure last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and attack a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people who cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die by a heart attack.
<unk> is an Italian authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do we serve <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> a foreign <unk>
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the U.S. secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool by 3,000 euros the Afghan government.
The company headquarters right here.
That is, Western governments provide tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It was <unk> the Internet connection.
We have even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's actually a game in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we would have today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any animal that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our won.
This is one of them who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and found it dead I felt very bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to protect them, and that's why we valued them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying, and they protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park, National Park.
A child in my community, in the age of six to nine years old, is responsible for livestock of his father, and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions would give fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping lions see the pen away.
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions to believe that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they got the second day, but the second day, and they said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So it jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, the lions don't come from.
I found out that lions are afraid of light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on to turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
They were going to get everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and battery <unk> the electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> come out because that's where lions.
And this is how they see lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed many animals -- the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they are serving very much.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to scare other predators, as anxious, and also being used for <unk> elephants as well.
And thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and show them how to do it <unk>
So one year back, it was just a kid in meadows in the savanna, the cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes, and he said that some day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come on to TED.
My great dream is to get an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting a story is to hear a story like yourself.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions here.
What is the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one close electric -- CA: One fence <unk>
<unk> I know you invented electrical fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: I read it once, at the same time, right, and I have tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it on every single step that I would get my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed a suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks before.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
I was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in her arms watching her face of his mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about them and their families.
A huge famine <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and tree tree.
They also became more and more prevalent the energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights in the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a North Korean photo in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves to North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
I sometimes see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as refugee refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear of my identity to be <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for Chinese police and <unk> me in the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake report -- she's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum seekers in <unk>
But many can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though it had been killed, they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight that hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, everybody can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to lead to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through a identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was a country that I could call a pride of mine.
Although I went to the life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I started to study for the school exam to college.
Just when I was starting to go back to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities took some money to submitted to my family, and as blame, my family was going to be moved to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Pole.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to do it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went down several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by an Chinese police officer.
He asked everybody, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at myself, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after moving the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated over again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the <unk>
I went and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to try to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
And at that time, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family, and for two North Koreans and <unk>
I went through my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I am helping the people <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown unknown is <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to go to the <unk> when they did it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, we met in South Pole.
But to achieve its freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, expertise in English language, practice and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family contact.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Pole to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles -- as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles to South Africa, <unk> <unk> <unk> terrain.
Just like <unk> millions of other people living in a food desert, Los Angeles Center for the home food places to take and eat on the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to take kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Angeles in Los Angeles South Africa.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I will tell you about seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of your house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see the <unk> wheels and sold as cars <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this should stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I just got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that doesn't have any pesticides.
What I did, was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet by x three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what come in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is what I decided to do it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> and we started planting our food and food forest -- you know, nine full <unk>
What we do, we are kind of paid paid for gardeners of all the <unk> from the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody <unk>
The city looked at me and just summary I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made reverse chronological order.
And I said, "Come on, "Come on it?
A court order to plant food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's get it."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. story had written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
He's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 <unk>
That's enough enough to plant <unk> million plants in <unk>
Why on Earth does it look like this?
They would take a plant to give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
It takes your own food to make your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there. Tell my kids there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my <unk> I cultures my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You will start to see what the earth can do, if you let their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You can see how they affect kids.
The gardening is the most <unk> act and provocative that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night, and they were in my garden, and I went out and look very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hunger, and this is just it <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to rob your <unk>
I say, "Oh my God no, I am not afraid you're going to go away."
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at the same time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people that come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that you're out there -- I see color kids that are on this path designed for them, that doesn't take them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who were engaged in their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all of a block block block where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I didn't get stuck.
I'm not talking for free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to start working people, pull the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, leading farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want you all to become a <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners are <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take their <unk>
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some crap.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace <unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very nice road at all.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days as today, where it rains, a lot.
You can have a lot of water on asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if they go out on your bicycle and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
Moreover, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material -- and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, close to cities, we would want a quiet road in a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make roads out of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the rain water flow into the sides and they will have a road because it's easy to drive, and they don't get more water to it.
Noise will also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise -- all the noise -- so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road on the surface of the surface of the surface <unk>
First of a stone, then more and more and more and more and more and more, well, I won't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
<unk>
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so you only have a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they'll become <unk> and they'll separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use knitting wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat heat, and especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used the <unk> because I can't bring the great machine back here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the prove that I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
So we did a lot of samples out there and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We've got to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 feet of the highway <unk> where we had to do a computer lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road test, and then, of course, this road last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then with our <unk> machine and ours and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even if you can double the surface of the surface, they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it plays the repair around.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray radius.
I had a big smile on his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is usually going to be <unk>
The Taliban <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what it was, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban fled Afghanistan and made girls go to school.
For the next five years, I was trained as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could do it <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that we were shopping.
School was in a house, over 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
When the school suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it was <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. It was in their daughter, my mother, to the school, and so her father would take it out.
But my senior mother became mastery.
This is it.
He took out two years ago, just to turn our home into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to educate her children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated with our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you stop your home during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So you don't want to go down.
I am 22 now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women who have more than the school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I am here proud to graduate my graduate school.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was married from her home to the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who lead him to the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I was in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador to <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It is why they <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though and even in front of a <unk> opposition.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and her daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I get to her house, they are the phone, a voice was given that if I kept sending her daughter to school, you would get it back to trying.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "but I won't harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
You don't mean our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> from his daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would notice that these changes didn't last long after the retirement of the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were wandering around for them, I see them, I see a future <unk> future and durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day girls from <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never have a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and men <unk> were at the edge, <unk> each of the regime, the <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a courage to the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy nutrition, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have wanted, along with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society to <unk> and a critical transition and fair towards democracy and national reconciliation, and a national reconciliation transition.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about development of capacities and leadership.
With an amazing group of women -- we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> <unk> for <unk> a women's movement leaders, very <unk> of the woman and for our right participation right in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment at the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was becoming more and more <unk> than the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved, and successful.
Women were won by the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, gradually the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day, we were all the news of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another one gives you the news of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day, we woke up with the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their expecting human rights violations.
Our society, made out of a revolutionary mindset, <unk> more, and it's gone away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today to get involved with our history of the <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose worse, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't get peace and stability and security to Libya.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> both by men as in women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the election, which is just going to take the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the gender depiction of the most than needing <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as treatment, and call it a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but it's also making mercy rather than <unk> our collaboration rather than the competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by the war, needs desperately to end the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which tries to <unk> and <unk> between <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known to all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> that spans the entire humanity that men and women, who all the tribes and all the people have been <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside the divine array of compassion <unk> all existence.
This is what it tells us, "My mercy <unk> all things."
This is what it tells us, "My Fulbright mercy on my <unk>
They were all given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a specific question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is that all of us are doing -- why does it look like?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who gave him <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, or education in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green green <unk> and he had a very big secret here.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, I was standing on my head with a <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> where they fall every year and millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies, <unk> <unk> between them and Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I've been nearly 20 years old with my second husband and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the races, all religions, every income levels and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and their domestic abuse is just men, and the domestic abuse is just going on in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to be able to find <unk> for which, their domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would sit with a man who sticks, and I actually went a typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands and <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first was that he had also <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and I worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that it seemed like a field.
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things made it <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of mate.
He did it especially in the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything from me, which was so list, that I had gone to Harvard, who would put a passion to help girls teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it before.
And it was why the lesson of that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leaving my work on my dreams, but I thought I'd do sacrifices for your partner, so I wanted to let my work and get it, and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head and financial trap and psychological psychological ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe I bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept it under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that she lived in a little bit.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never lifted my hand, my life was serious about a minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was the seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit, and I married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were happy to live happily because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It had just felt very <unk> by the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and it never would hurt me.
I spent two times on our <unk>
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving out of our moon of honey was held by traffic <unk> and threw a Mac Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> once a week for the next two years and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is to be a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and he was the only person in the world who could help <unk> cope with the <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why just not <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the most sad and agonizing question that people are victims, because we all the victims, we know something that you normally do: it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence in cases of domestic violence happen after the victim has finally put to the relationship, after the <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges going to spend time with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still ask why it's just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat that beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone to the world -- to my neighbors, my neighbors and my friends and family, to full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you are telling me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as women's <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> <unk> -- as if the <unk> victims are committed <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> that they learned a lesson from what happened to them -- and that they <unk> their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I went back to marry a cute man, and I have these three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to having never more, is a gun <unk> pointing my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid people <unk> but all this time I have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, the ones that are listening to right now, that they're being <unk> or that they are being <unk> or that they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, her sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy, particular love, breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my final request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
substance thrive just in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence, simply shedding light over it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic and <unk> people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence for intervening consciously, to slow their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of safe and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel like this moment is a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first change in a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of luck to <unk> I think.
If some of the women <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but we'll find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very <unk> less than I don't have to use it.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater on the head, because it's when they're going to make fun of me, so you don't do anything while I covers your mind.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would put your back and get my hair off of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or a <unk> <unk> like the one that I did two days for the work, there are very little to be able to transform our aspect, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being bold means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman, and in my labor sector, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always doing it, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get a role model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm a <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape of <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> Hold on, Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all and every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- is less than four percent, they weren't white people.
The next question that people are always asking me is: Does it be a model when you imagine.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't care about that.
But then, what I would really tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> chief of American <unk> or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's outside your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you finish your studies, and you have a stick and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you <unk> is, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, pretty much of all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
And this was the first picture I got in, and the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal space, but it was a little girl.
It looked next to my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came up with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and all their <unk> and people in <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is, "Is it things for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> <unk> a red light -- and of course, we were <unk> and <unk> an agent -- agent and <unk>
<unk> of these privileges <unk> for my respect, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year of the teenage <unk> of teenage <unk> were black and <unk> and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's about how many times I got <unk> and <unk>
When I research for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent to 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is: If you're a little thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe I would do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative creative people, clever and passionate knowledge.
And it's all true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask, with a little bit more thin legs and the brightest hair will be happier?
You just have to meet a bunch of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the <unk> but probably are the physically women that are physically <unk> on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial racial oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope that everybody is more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures -- and I wasn't me who <unk> them.
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimal caring of the lighting in the light.
In fact, most of them took tourists random.
My story begins when I was in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took this picture holding my picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
So I happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take me to New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that were going to get us from the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a full unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, nobody has ever <unk> with the camera.
At the time, we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a structural moment or a specific trip.
They're also a way of stopping time on a week in October and to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
So recently, on one of the trips we were walking around, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the pirate store that <unk> small views in previous <unk>
And he described to me what felt like to the five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart heart to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in a lot of family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes out of the picture.
I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't go back to somebody and ask him, and we get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are found in the most ambitious birds group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs like silly characters.
More recently, if you have been following the press and you just applause and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World who found primarily in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the West <unk> where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are you going to get them important? First of all, they provide ecological drug services with us.
They're our <unk> natural <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill kill all of the bacteria. They really help absorb anthrax that they wouldn't be by them stretched and generated large livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between literature and under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> god risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture is going to be a few very important <unk> in places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey to livestock consumption which has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs -- <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb to <unk> The number of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> go up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we need to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see they travel through different countries, so to focus on a locally problem that's not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can they help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you that we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you're reporting on the <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he was flying without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I make my life <unk> has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we <unk> the <unk>
Our first project, the one that inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where we were a few Italians and we decided to teach people to grow food.
So we come up with <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely cool valley that goes down to the river <unk> and we teach the local growing and tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were going to take them to work, and sometimes they didn't get <unk>  We were convinced that the local people, so fertile valley, they had not had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  Let's take time to save the people of the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
And we got these gorgeous <unk> in Italy, a <unk> could grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful and red and red, at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> You never <unk>
I thought we only did Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, they did what the French did, what the French did, and after seeing what was doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>   <unk> see the waste that gave them to the <unk> people of Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was released in 2009.
We, Western countries, we have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not telling you about the damage that money has <unk>
They just read your book.
<unk> part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want you a lot too much.
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The small is <unk> written by <unk> who said about it all over economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, Mr. man who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can -- you can just imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years just answering people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you ever <unk> but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It was <unk>
You never get a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee -- we met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for her own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years back, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, for once, but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they're never going to tell them at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have to <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't even play their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face -- you have to create social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business who sets up with you in your house, at the table of his kitchen -- in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform her passion in a way of a living.
And I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia in Western Australia, and I started this.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this liminal garbage that we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
I was <unk> and I got you.  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've started 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in the story, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before getting involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of <unk>
planning is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer them to give you a <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> come in mass mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people -- intelligence and passion?
So what do you talk about is that you have <unk>
Local <unk> That's what you have to <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneur spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils that are not renewable <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a routine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> they gathered this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not in 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population kept growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would lead to New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> companies, <unk> companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few times, <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they will not come and talk to you.
Then you have to offer an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then you have to tell the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the larger company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 people of the world <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all new Google companies, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have common -- only one one, no one was started by one person.
The word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small businesses in bars in bars and bars with the comrades on the comrades who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for this gentleman is about this <unk> someone who asked you, what needs to be <unk>
What can you? Can you do it? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." It's going to look for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us around us are all around us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't spend a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes to empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries, and I trust a city.
That always goes to music.  There's a show in New York   The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest abandoned property properties.
I live near this house, and I thought about how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Her death was sudden and was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and I thought much.
And it took me a profound gratitude for time and lived in time.
It gave it clarity to the significant things of my life.
But let's take this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to get on the day and forget the really important thing to you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I died I want to be <unk> by <unk>  "Before I died I want to sit down to <unk> on the line of <unk>
"Before I died I want to sing for millions of people.
"Before you die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I died I want to live out of the <unk>
"Before I died, I want to celebrate once more."
"Before you die I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
"Before I died I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of the people and hope for people to laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the center of civic center, we made a kit kit and now of all over the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share one another.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions rising is more important than ever, to find ways of preserving the perspective and remember that life is short and delicate life.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we are going to prepare for death is one of those things that give us more power.
If you think about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care as individuals and as community and more media to share hope and more media to share hope and stories, people around us not only can help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
You don't talk to speak, but it makes better joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
<unk> <unk> happens what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and notice in this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood -- trying to say words that I couldn't even make it, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years. It's very hot.
He <unk> the <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we maintained when I was four years old, I would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady birthday <unk>
It doesn't look <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds are not fit into the concept of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what he propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you don't consider them inside the <unk> that would only mean one thing: they were autistic and some extraordinary people.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects learning and learning to the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> be so different from Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, it's diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that goes faster in the world, there is no cause or cure cure, there is no cause.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eat anything that we <unk>
As it was growing up, it would become more different, and the differences were getting more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without boxes, a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that you've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> happens to the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could take a single thing to <unk> and Sam and then you have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> It's a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner and honestly, the search for normal, is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a computer teacher who gave a kind of communication to graduate students.
I was scared.  <unk> of real students with his big minds, his big books and its big and unknown and <unk> words.
But the develop of those conversations, I felt what it was -- it must have sense when he went through the rabbit hole and saw the door in a new world.
And so I felt when I had those conversations with the students. I really surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a huge communication.
We desperately need a lot of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges -- from energy and health care and health care -- among others, and if we don't know we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question to ask you, and then what?
So why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them silly ones.
Instead, as Einstein said, it's as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly your science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. It's ways of turning it into their content.
And when I present their work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> kill the bullets say, and they have your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's also supporting too much in the language area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the <unk> Tower of the <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we provide graphics that connects our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding of what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the room for a public charge or a thought, and that when he wins, you get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed to quote the exact words to quote the exact words were told on the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by the <unk>
He got into the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's literal <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to actually show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington Washington, a leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tested quality.
And not even with that, they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be picked by King by a given piece of paper.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper in a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House House didn't want Washington to become <unk>
They didn't want to call him the King of her or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> more <unk> and the most unfortunate <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. I did not invented the title. There was only before, but it was only <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a trivial title.
And that's why the Senate was <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take serious about a degree as ridiculous and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one, and I have been able to figure out the Senate has never <unk> the title of the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between <unk>
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you, is that the American American title doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to note, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have accompanied the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, just like <unk> well, it was a rescue.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them you're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do is to you.
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually the reality changes much more the words than these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under land in a illegal mine in the illegal mine.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, especially that cacophony of male <unk> and stones and <unk> with primitive tools.
Like others, I have a cheap light flashlight of light -- he holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches that hold the walls of that <unk> hole that drops a hundred feet on the ground.
He <unk> my hand, and I suddenly remember a <unk> I met a few days before, who lost control and dropped <unk> feet on that well.
While I talk to you today, these men are deep deep in that hole at risk their lives without paying no reward, and often dying.
I walked out of that hole and went home, but they may never will. Because they are prey to slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 continents in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there was <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
So we started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was in the world but not to such a degree.
When we ended up talking about I felt very sad, I was really afraid I was going to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me up, my stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
And interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered me my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during all of the <unk> <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> of <unk>
However, today, you can enslave entire families for additional generations for 18 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates revenues of over 13 billion dollars a year worldwide.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education, better work to then find out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery is operating on <unk> goods that are produced by slaves have value, but those who produce are disposable ones.
And slavery exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This weird and <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families made up in a heavy pool of <unk> filled in their heads, and then 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over 16 to 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee <unk> no to drink, and the severe <unk> made it pee pretty <unk>
As <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the equipment and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment on the way that these people.
Back on the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was in my side very quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it here."
And it explained to me so clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not the citizenship of that country.
He could put it in a worse situation than they already were.
I had to rely on the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and complained that he <unk>
As I waited for me to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found kids <unk> <unk> stones for <unk> land until they were waiting on the bottom.
These big <unk> were more heavy than the children who had charge and the children put them into their heads with straps and <unk> made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, they had completely lost.
When you hear the word slavery often thought of sexual trafficking, and because of the world consciousness advised me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously been <unk>
I got a lot of stairs which gave me to this dirty basement of faint light light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local for forced prostitution
They have small rooms, private rooms, where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are forced to go to clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each put is dark and dirty and identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a <unk> fear of <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a little bit of a <unk> the stairs where they were going.
There was no doors.
There were no windows enough to be <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, as you touch a serious topic, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children sold every year as sex <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often meets the labor of <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family family.
The black hands of black men are the father, and the <unk> of blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, that we can go out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the lake -- the world's greatest lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a look at fast.
I saw what seemed to be a trained family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger children, some younger kids, it makes sense.
<unk> were all the slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families and <unk> and forced to work on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> I found her little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
<unk> branches of trees in Lake <unk> and they often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, they get thrown into water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always forced to work in the lake.
And fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to <unk> younger <unk>
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working since the time.
<unk> and <unk>
And I would be able to point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which he <unk> the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi is going to be possible.
Who will come to be because of somebody who decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> out of a road in Ghana with partners, the <unk> a partner, a fellow who was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> our car and hit the window.
And he asked us to take it through a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were moving out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
And then he pointed to this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the path.
As we started going down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of my head to the <unk> of my head as I went to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of the <unk> and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied their back, and while they were looking for gold, they were looking for <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are embedded in a well in a different part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were embedded in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people have taken heavy plastic bags that will then be shipped back to another area where they were able to extract the stone to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer close to the margin we see others less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died their uncle, I would prevent the debt of the uncle as a slave strength in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors would say it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and nevertheless, that's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Still, he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a remote possibility -- which inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to take witness to them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like <unk>
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, I think I've had the great honor to meet.
And I hope that these images take a force in who you see in people like you, and I hope that force turns out a fire and that <unk> light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue living in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical mathematics, and there's a peculiar problem for whom we are <unk> we're like the management consultants of management,
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Play is one of the most human activities.
We were tracking the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demand a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity -- and probably some initial <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders as Parkinson's of Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years, it's been made progress on treatment.
But there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need finite tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately the only way we know if there is actually a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the movement are not <unk> and so they don't serve blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials, they never do. It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam for ourselves?
You wouldn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that I want to <unk> as a really conventional way to try, you see, in a certain sense, all of us are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating ropes.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds when you speak, we can imagine as a <unk> because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes that we need -- for example.
And as the guards requires an extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
So from sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as they <unk> and like the Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
You can see in the bottom of the <unk> you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of elastic ropes.
We see the same <unk>
They shake a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot like a lot.
They're minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears at a massive scale.
These are some incredible goals for <unk>
We can reduce our patient care.
We would not need to go to the clinic for the nearest <unk>
<unk> monitoring we could get targets.
We could do a massive low-cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have affordable lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> or <unk> can call under price and throwing recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples from, say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. Yeah.
<unk> you can see, some people may not be able to do it, may not do it."
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances, is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion to look for the real markers of disease.
TR: You have an precision <unk> at this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we did the project. Now we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're hungry creatures.
We are tracking it in the dark, underground field, and by large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- we make the impossible -- and we would focus on the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
A short time later, an organization where was <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May, I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen of fishermen located in the <unk> <unk> of nearly 50,000 people, one of the first people affected in the wave, of nearly 50,000 people.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet high, and more than three kilometers into the ground inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
It <unk> rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> schools, we removed the mud and we leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local farm.
We love us, and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers and their neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and draw pictures and cameras and punch cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of people around them to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
I helped to clean the stall, huge <unk> <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> center <unk> the photos.
I had the honor and I had the honor that this day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until moved through my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- they were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
There was no way too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the little girl with the girl and so much precision and <unk>
And otherwise that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as you have the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they came by luck and more <unk> and it got more <unk> so he came back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village to north of <unk>
So once a week we use our scanner into the temporary management libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could <unk> an hour. I could <unk>
It could be months.
This <unk> had to draw virtually a hand on hand using the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures would be <unk> in saltwater, covered with bacteria, even with oil, all of it along with the step of time -- I continue to stand up with that, and then <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't take the photo at least that it was clean down, dry and had been <unk> by their <unk>
We were lucky enough with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
And I had begun to <unk> her, but stopped when you realize the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not have been, we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their photos they shared some of their history with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the photos on a fire station, between the very far from where he used to be their house, but his colleagues would be <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter closing the barriers to the wave, and her husband was <unk>
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
His little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his photographs her seven and her son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at, something that I could remember from the past day that was not marked by that March day when everything was changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them helped us to clean up with a lot of <unk> photos -- the great <unk> -- the great majority of the <unk> -- the vast majority came to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to return to 90 hundred and hundreds of pictures completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more of value 1,000 in teams and materials, and most ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would call it to us, but the first thing you might want to look for.
This is what the project is, to restore small pieces of humanity, to come back to somebody with the past.
When a picture like this gets back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger, back to something, using their talents to something that is not being thin models of perfect skin.
So to end my email -- I would like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy that came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the young girl, gathering around a baby, and I was embarrassed because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my newborn daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are themselves, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition in just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique as fast as you can create videos in the light of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> of the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and really defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it down and <unk> in a second or so, in a number of <unk> to create a photons of photons and just a millimeter of width of size.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet has a regular bullet than a common bullet than a regular bullet than a common bullet than a regular bullet than a common bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a common bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a common
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you spread out those photons inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of the light on <unk>
Now, all of this --  Remember that all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> that's what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to take this research --  -- <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a <unk> package starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get to the cap and then explode in a number of directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces off inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights at the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after a number of boxes, that the reflections of the <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and we do the same distance and we see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think would take us to see that film?
One day? A week -- actually, every year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow bullet in motion.
And what about how about nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a rock into a pond.
It is the way nature paints a picture, and I was like, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full <unk>
But if you look at once more and more of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light goes out of the tomato <unk> it keeps <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside its interior and it goes out and go out and get out of various <unk> a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is mature without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera in the India?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture at the bottom of the exposure, it comes into very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the fastest <unk> so I just got into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a dummy and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works this quickly, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good time resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also all the way to hidden objects, but we don't know what a point corresponds to what's going on.
By projecting a laser you can record a photo in short, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction for this.
We have things for us to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's going around the curve, and in the future.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by open windows into open windows and open windows.
We could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body by having <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new design modality to solve the problems of developing developing <unk>
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, it turned science into art, an art of photographs of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data we collect every time are not just for scientific visualization, but we can be able to see it.
I create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and color colors.
And look at those ripples -- remember, time between each one of those waves is just about <unk>
But there is also something fun.
If we look at waves underneath the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have foreign effects -- Einstein would have liked to see this image.
The order in which the events in the world are sometimes <unk> on the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, it will move it into <unk> and become famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were gathering for change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who here have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 sets of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This directive says that every mobile phone company, every provider of the entire Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends him a text to <unk>
And if we use the cellphone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company, or their phone <unk>
And all across Europe people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention <unk>
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, priests, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10 thousand people that came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police in East Asia.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that at that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, for favor of all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a specific answer -- it was all the <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to put a lawsuit for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we don't give this information.
At the end of it, they <unk> an agreement.
I would take the demand and they sent me the information I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about a <unk>
And the CD was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> I wear information lines.
And I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a little bit, what do I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and off, go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going to train them on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we're talking a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how their people communicate each other to what time they call each other, what time they do to sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the center, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of Berlin, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if we knew it, I had known people who were the leaders, this never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe I'd never happened.
And in a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to take it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When you return home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, it's not just fashion.
When you go home, we take it to your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what are you going to store you from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi <unk> What happens?
Not enough.
Hi <unk> What happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> nor can't <unk>
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not source source, and I don't want any of us to do that.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled.
We're going for a walk.
At Christmas, they are at the shopping mall, driving in circles looking for parking spaces, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same first place.
I also love that if I want to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents took the school system to the school system, and they were <unk> that I would also know -- and if we didn't take all of the ultimate note -- all of us had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used to do was hang a dollar in front of me so that he <unk>
The <unk> which I carry inside was very hard, and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a <unk> <unk> which has received a lot of taps.
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 cities, and they're still all of the family.  I think no one realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
People who I grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot that was worth hungry during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eat, so <unk> from dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay the physical therapy -- so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I was spending my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to stay in <unk>
On the summer vacation I was often trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> put me warm cups on the back, I was going to get back to the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before you were doing yoga was a comedian of <unk> who couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college, through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
All of us are <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took out the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene of the glass Zoo.
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with a cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> In order to have a <unk>
I have paralysis, <unk>
At the end of it, they finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater, crying crying -- historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask why and she told me that because they believed that I could not make the stunts at risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, I can't do the <unk> either.
It was a role for the one who had literally been born and gave an actor without a cerebral <unk>
The university was to share my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I graduated home, and my first tour tour, it was as extra in a <unk>
My dream made it happen.
And I knew it would be <unk> <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> and I didn't see myself more than <unk> and it was clear to me that <unk> directors not <unk> actors -- not white, <unk> with disability.
They just encourage perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, he took comic books from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when she went on the head of the New Jersey in the New Jersey and a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you've never heard that little rumor that it says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my mother's brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> of New York, now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and to remind me to remind the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arabs were much easier than fighting the challenge of stigma for disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was listening to the news program for cable <unk>
I walked up to a graduate dance, I went down to a study and sat around me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I grabbed on the desk of the host to not go out on the screen during the <unk> and when I ended the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and the <unk> knew they would not get me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but she was in the course of the <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never get rid of me or no girl and no older than that.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object.
You have video clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite guy, <unk> terrorist attacks.
What disease is that?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> comedian, <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't get someone on the wheelchair.
<unk>
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that I don't know, but I'm here in front of you.
However, I grew up with media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images that were <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> trip has led me to very spectacular places.
I arrived at <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I arrived in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> children -- a charity to give the children refugees Palestinians to Palestinians -- a little bit of what my parents gave me up.
It was the only time my father saw me live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know her name, but I know her story.
She lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the <unk> of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day a guy who gives him to <unk> after dinner, after dinner, and <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little money to buy new clothes, money to send home, your family.
I read a young lady.
Finally, he home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That child of that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization to the Qaeda.
So how did the story of a little boy in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that he did.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who were unemployed in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking at something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, labor jobs, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terror, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of mutual cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work at school.
They don't do pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, "What if I had never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor young leaders at a business rate.
They took a bunch of 90 leaders who are juveniles <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the large challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a graduate university <unk> frustrated, I was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
The biggest hurdle to get from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> motorcycles for local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and her dream is at some point to go to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this a story?
What does this different story do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> in <unk>
It will inspire young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so helpful.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
He was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative to do.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until recently, until recently, before you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic to go from abroad.
If you gave somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk>
I created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> and he said, "You could survive the hard weather <unk>
And it started the <unk> <unk> creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink pink <unk>
By the way, he is not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for government, but their story, its innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They have business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a <unk> culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas reality.
They need expertise and orientation to drive them into development and set it out of their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that need to be <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and to create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park -- this is how it's called, when it is created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids out of the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their <unk> innovation and have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in North New York State.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was made that the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we <unk> almost to pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> of a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with an apple hearts -- aluminum <unk> balls <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
And that question followed with me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you were going to <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> Department of <unk> is the reason by 11 tons of waste.
I wanted to meet as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What do you feel about using the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I interviewed people in office and I interviewed people in office and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more <unk>
So I started working as a trash student.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks.
And they operated the <unk> mechanical and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and in the days that it's very strong you would get quickly <unk>
It costs a lot about weight weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of trash every weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of technical data, the waste collection is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and go through all the day around.
They just want to kill you, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about how relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is as a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It's always supposed to be moving.
And the stigma.
I think that stigma is especially ironic because I think the <unk> of waste are the most important work of the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient form and effective form every day, this starts <unk> of their containers and their dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
We had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs the needs.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for the new thing that the engines of economics begin to fail when it's endangered the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out their relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed rate.
I mean by simply at the speed of that they used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't have any <unk> and we cleaned up or we carry our coffee cup.
We use them, we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that you can take about it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that maybe to help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, in a <unk> way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that they keep us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow will always stay in one way or another.
On one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste on the streets, I took my son small and I got the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that I started researching the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> We work together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe I was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have in account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
<unk> waste that we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and in their lives, the next few people who see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, let me give you a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born of conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall of several floors, in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because of the <unk> it generates heat inside the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees for all the year.
And thirdly, his appearance is nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a worth of being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really enchanted with the ancient market that is the open air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of several stories applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey of the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the hits of the building.
And this is spread out with an inclined atrium, which creates a space in the open air in the building, which is <unk> by their own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space form.
I also thought, how close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would challenge the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons from dresses in <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas did not be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what they <unk>
But ultimately we realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the business center because at the end of the world there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary we had air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building in a city in which electricity was cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water for the <unk>
This is waiting for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a <unk> master plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a project that was so big, the bigger that I have designed is not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I got special attention to the <unk> a thousand years of ancient years that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen doors of connecting with almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was <unk> the existing streets, creating 12 earlier blocks like the size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this changes the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like <unk> as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So I would give you a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that make a higher density at the upper levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving back.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and make activities like running a race of two kilometers in the morning, or to jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between community and environment, and they have to connect nature to the people with the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was just as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of very bright hair and a little <unk> of <unk> cute. It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I was doing my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in time after the <unk> was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I went from my teacher to the grades.
And then I did.
I would take the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some like this.
All the Like this.  And I signed up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and myself in a row out of it, just because it was there, because it <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came out.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was struck by the reason that I was concerned that this little girl was so good at <unk>
Would jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates.
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of murders of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the <unk> or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we study <unk> in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no <unk> King <unk>
No Shakespeare.
<unk> the lists of reading from high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, most of them has all of them.
This year, they become 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search for the <unk> <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of my own, and my whole thing that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in you."
We forgot how hard it is.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said were so hard as a cat.
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so good together, the novel and <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as that astronomers that get reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel crazy: we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience -- we know exactly what details we can do to <unk> the knife -- isn't it?
<unk> are made us all <unk> <unk> and that's something that I wanted to understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give you, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to themselves that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> is that he adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. We have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big quantities of hair, bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links very well with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of soon listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with true value.
<unk> is trying to demonstrate that the <unk> look at <unk> and they make us look <unk> but in their <unk> it's search for knowledge, looking for the truth, a painful truth -- in fact, what they were going to do, the more agonizing the truth, the best.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs -- that makes us suffer, causes us to create a lot more powerful feelings and vital that a wise man can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other excitement we were telling us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity that teaches us.
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young <unk> who was consumed with the idea that her wife <unk>
And Freud said that there was something strange in that man, he didn't get sick in what his wife.
It was <unk> everyone knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that I was doing his wife, without having it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or do it accidentally <unk>
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels really describe very well how <unk> make us look at intensity but without accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely possible we are, the more we are, we are more likely to become a residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are led to violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drive us behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake <unk> on Facebook from which he would send horrible <unk> messages to itself, for one year.
For a year. It's a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of her former mother, <unk> I have to confess that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What huge though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like an Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane of the membrane the membrane that it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to pull out of your own and <unk> from what you've ever <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> to your name, it takes your rings, cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the way around the world, as much as I could.
It's a shame, because we live at the time of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
The novels shows you. I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what characters always do when you're not sure, when you're at a mystery.
Let's go to the Baker Street Baker and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the Oscar <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs <unk> <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we do it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of those cases.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to hold your hands.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> title in history. I think this is really emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It might even be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get away from the greatness of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction <unk>
<unk> fiction -- the jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> the invites you to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> the terrifying one, Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Ross Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get the moon, NASA took about 180 billion dollars of today or four percent of the federal budget today.
Apollo gave the work of a 400,000 400,000 people and asked 20,000 companies, and universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which has collapsed after Armstrong death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that the 24 were <unk> after that, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The <unk> answer is that the President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better?
But the <unk> words at University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why can you scale the <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
It was because it was a great thing to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of assembly and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the half of the century, it was <unk> and we eliminated the smallpox.
Technology looked like owning what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship, or in 1969, the <unk> crew crew flew to 40,000 miles <unk>
From 1970, no human being has returned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the <unk> <unk> and the optimism of the technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we could solve is how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding cancer, or feed the world's population seem to be <unk>
I remember the Apollo 17.
And I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the escape tube <unk> of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission, <unk> but I was completely sure I could see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard that all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists had found us -- and they had enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they didn't give the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which has been created that have been created by less ambitious companies, which is <unk> from the years to be <unk> Intel Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> to concrete, the incentives that risk capitalists give entrepreneurs for risk.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused it to get rid of the creation of <unk> ideas by <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It <unk> mostly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their point in their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment, minute that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technology as energy, which need an enormous capital and whose development is in the long term. You haven't invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a commercial value right away.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deep here.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption as solar energy, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties <unk> development of an <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of price control.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are result of failure in the delivery of food.
But 30 years of research have been taught that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and delivery for food, but there will be famines as there were bad governments.
Finally, the big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon president, declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are a lot of cancer types, some resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions must be really a problem with it, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it does it with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> difficult and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like the way we explore the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have been about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> has been a great decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief,
The second is an goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> an objective and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First, why do people think confidence has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to you to think that there may be dropped in some activities or institutions and that could be increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to the surveys of opinion, and polls are allegedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no many evidence of it.
That is, the people who are passionate about 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, they follow <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they keep being a lot of <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly exactly in the middle of the road.
But this is what enough?
What <unk> opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do it?
What you're looking at are <unk> attitudes that people behave when you ask them certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on <unk> teachers.
probably <unk> by asking, "What do you for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
Which is really rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to trust trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a determined kind of official or a person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying I trust a certain teacher of elementary school I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all of that knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they're trying to <unk> the good judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
That's not the goal that I <unk>
I will encourage you to have more confidence in what it is about trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of no trust what it's not reliable.
And I think those people who take their savings out of very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> in the <unk> commodity and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends that are <unk> and honest -- but I didn't get into them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they will take their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I haven't <unk>
But that's what we're interested in most of us before trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be?
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've been trying to build accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and so forth, that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said to me, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will go to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and I think that the accountability system that is destined to guarantee and the evidence of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You probably all know similar examples.
So let's take it all over the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different from being worthy of the confidence and to tell people that we are reliable and whether to try to determine whether other people or policy or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the simple actions -- simple actions -- what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately is signature because they give us a lot of other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, it's because you can't fully <unk> all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to give us evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, all the common people, <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- says I can <unk> it without giving explanations to us.
I wear them and return me money, or they get me through the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you go back vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is the relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a light screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I hadn't <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to the pixels.
Designers can put their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How can we get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Science <unk> from Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital area.
So we would take a transparent display with deep cameras to detect their fingers and face, now you can lift the keyboard, of the keyboard, the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and I'll highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
These examples, in these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
We had many of us to afford to afford and returned to things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
So what I've got here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would you be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical game.
This electromagnet magnet is behaving as a pixel language in space, which means that so much the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of quantum levitation and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and then at the distance, and the famous end of Michael Jordan can reproduce as a physical reality of the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the movement of the planets, the physical and, unlike <unk> or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how programming the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to take care of our world.
So we started the talk today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all the expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they create firmly that there was just a accurate way to the <unk> a safe and good job <unk>
No matter if I work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an African opera singer,
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer needs to start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to an opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
All my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew I was too much better to train.
My dream never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> Okay.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I arrived in the United States in 1995, and what were the first books on here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> It's about Chinese <unk> life.
And it's not propaganda a convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and much better than I <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> anywhere, and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my <unk> habit habit.
You know, a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, I found this map, because this is what students in China learn.
I had never seen that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to fields of research as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers to academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading comparative work worked for research, why don't you do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
It can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a very <unk> <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are sustainable, politics and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people of the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to come back and feel just <unk>
Having a broken dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
The most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where the dreams comes from, where the passion comes from.
Until a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in psychology clinic at Berkeley.
She was a woman from 26 years called <unk>
And Alex came to the first session using jeans and a encountered <unk> threw on the couch of my office grabbed the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class class had a <unk> like the first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move your head while we were doing the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying Alex, and so I looked to her, she was right.
You start to work after, you start to work on, she has kids later, until death happens later.
For the <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat.
But little later, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about her life <unk>
I was hooked.
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with these guys under your category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> with the other.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they had, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and her loving life, but for race to the families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to age, without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yeah!
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> remove your dream a <unk> I want to see. It's good. <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be in the 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 and experiences and moments and moments that give their life to you will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People of more than 40, no panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner to the 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final phase of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change themselves, it's now time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other moment of life, and we know that the female fertility gets to their top on top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the developing child, we all know that the first five years are pivotal for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which his everyday and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline of the <unk>
The researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> names to the <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> what's actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
That's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing about anything.
And then every single day, <unk> smart, interesting people like you or your kids and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything is okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better hug the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes for the <unk> were like the game game.
They were all running and <unk> but at some point around the 30, it crashed the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit, but it doesn't get rid of the risks of a high high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to <unk> and so many of you start a career, pick a city, pick a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything of once to <unk>
The middle of middle-aged age is not about buying dense red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want to go.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother brother a child.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sit in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a few very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our <unk> but then they woke up herself to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, a day Emma got her head on his legs and he cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with her many new ones, but then I got looking at the empty space that follows after the words "In case we name <unk> please call <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who will be for me if I have an accident <unk>
Who is going to take care of me if I give you <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the <unk> <unk>
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who was <unk> from that identity crisis and the capital of identity.
For the capital capital I mean to do something that builds value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of the career <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity makes of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try it.
I am not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm looking at exploration that I should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make them tell.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the people who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to whom you know who you know how you know how you think about how you think about, how do you talk about, how they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes out of her <unk>
The new things come from what they call weak bonds of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the people have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak bonds are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the <unk> jobs never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job that was not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon fall to her family, when she has a partner and form her own family.
I said to Emma that his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit down that the 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person you live in now or now -- when everybody on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you do, and that means to be so <unk> in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or kill time with anyone who is <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a quarter who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, with that she alive.
Now, five years later, it's a special <unk> of events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I was sending me a letter to say, "Now the emergency room spaces are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or <unk> a good conversation, a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the people who have heard of.
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get rid of identity -- use their ties to swim with their holes, pick up your family.
Don't you know what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to seventh school students in New York City New York.
And as any teacher, I made tests and tests.
Let me tasks.
When I work back, we did grades.
What struck me is that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance did not have <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest children were not doing so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a specific perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
But what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study, my question was, who has this success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what to <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied professors who are working in really difficult neighborhoods, and what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, and what of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
Who is going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, it became a feature as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my influence, and then waited for about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when they were <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> testing, even the safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for the kids at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How much do you deal with children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a hard work work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is:  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, it's commonly related or is even related to the enjoyment of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that this is an idea that at Stanford University of Stanford <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and they grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I end up my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to fail, to start to start everything again with <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my <unk> memories -- is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned a new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic scholar <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy <unk>
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read <unk> traffic signals -- <unk> <unk> understanding the basic idea of web or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you can even be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
It tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates of an <unk> in the <unk>
I call it <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, two are <unk>
If a person lifted your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a monument as a <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, already as a speaker tree, is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two guys together, it gets very hot.
Three guys together, that's a lot of flames.
Hold the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun goes on the horizon.
A door. Put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, are <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will let you build 32.
The next group of eight characters to build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as learning a Chinese <unk>
So after I know the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun put into the beginning, because Japan is in the east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked up on the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I come to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw a Oz of Oz together.
The film took their imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand
But when you look at that film so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of complex industrial <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise over 40 years later with, funnily enough, another film called a metal boy and a <unk> boy who was a girl dressed as a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the Oz magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence on the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the Oz magician was doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as a prophecy.
I would make magic shoes to defeat the armies made by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing of the Oz magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did "Star "Star <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Only three years.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second child, and the <unk> level had <unk>  And so, she slid in the room and he was struck as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
He should feel that Luke was an army to <unk> the government?
This is <unk> this with the Oz of Oz of <unk>
How does Dorothy win the film?
In doing good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up with it, OK? And not a world of men that I think is where we are.
Why is there so much of the arms force on the movies for our children, and so little of the <unk> brick path.
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know from experience that Princess princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really hoped that the employees start to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is over, I have a <unk>
Why keep it standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost as if it's a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There's a lot of exceptions, to defend the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the children, although they, guys, are not really your target audience.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how they defend from <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful topic of all times is still appearing in classic after classical, each of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raised a child.
As many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. Because it's available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost no one of these movies happens to the <unk> test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not <unk> and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic books, and in the <unk> '80s, a conversation I had with a friend of <unk> of the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There's only three questions you need to be in the film, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something else from the guy than you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea, which is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think it would be a lot of the film, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film that happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Come to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular films, how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen for recently for Congress, then fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to come up with this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, right?
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music or pornography are closely <unk> but something wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What don't you get to <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools in our own way as a <unk> <unk> and we hope that we would ask you, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> -- yes, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we need to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is changing radically.
You've read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite <unk> favorite character you know what I <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and get more stories where you see that her work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things I loved was looking for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was interested in <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized I can see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to about 1.3 miles of length next to the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when you use <unk>
This is a place in the east Delta, of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in plain view, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process using color -- suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city to find an old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this enormous <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about <unk> per mile away.
Before, Nile on the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a map, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians by using <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of <unk> from several hundred years ago that came back from the Ottoman Empire, exactly the same period we think is <unk>
We also found jobs from <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> what proves that there was a workshop shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the rocks they <unk>
So we have a <unk> <unk> of occupation from the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry, which proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but let's go to the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire, probably it was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So I mean, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas actually began in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's made.
Now let's take a group of obese <unk> on bicycles.
They are competing in a <unk> race career and they go in the front door.
I need you to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of the door of their home.
There are bicycles flying around, wheels that go on the top of the wheels that you end up in <unk> <unk> the negativity threshold.
And so the hall in the hall, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, light glows from the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
<unk> from his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that's talking about.
Can you feel your blue <unk> by making them tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you think it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making maximum use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on his center <unk> singing <unk> I was <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> path and from the oven coming to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that is done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist -- I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, looking at them just once.
They took the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I have entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be the phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
And I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
All that involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We were trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques -- invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used to <unk> to memorize the speakers, and that medieval <unk> used to memorize books.
And my reaction was: "How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English guy, although a little bit of <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
Do you meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to show you Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards live in national TV.
That will prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, so sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential might be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem that's awesome.
It was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> <unk>
And to come back, I read a bunch of treaties on memory done something over 2,000 years ago in Latin America, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having the disciplined and disciplined memory wasn't a little thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest on their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also changed us.
They have changed the outside, and I would say that they have changed our cognitive too.
We have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate about people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there is like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know -- it's going to be brains in some structural way, structural or different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a <unk> battery battery and the answer was really not.
There was a really interesting difference in the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them on a functional MRI machine, you would throw your brains while you get to <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of <unk> found that the memory champions are made out of the brain, different from the brain, different people.
They actually <unk> or looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driven as an armed race in where each year appears to someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors must be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times exchange of memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards -- <unk> who is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was only <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits -- <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these directions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
And it illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox, <unk> he says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you -- that there's a man called <unk>
That's her <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you, <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what would you say?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the Baker, name is really nothing for you. It doesn't mean anything for you.
With all the other memories you're dancing in their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they go home to work.
You probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you take that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some given time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back a half thousand years ago in Ancient Greece in <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you didn't have a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his poem from memory, and he was <unk> and so soon it was, the hall of the <unk> <unk>
Let's go to everyone.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies that were <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
This is how they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped outside, only survivor, in the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every day.
I took the family of the <unk> hand, where his loved ones were the rubble.
What we <unk> pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter if we're not good to remember names or instructions on the phone or instructions that the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial history.
If you let them tell me, the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to do that very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the horse language in his lobby, you would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it from memory, the same way that I would have done it -- if you sent it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, <unk> and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to talk about is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then you go into the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they talked about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help remember it.
This is how <unk> speakers <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek that means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and on rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> it would be like the first place in your palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that an memory competition is an event, boring.
And seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting around taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing happening is when somebody <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I saw the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
You may have a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> <unk> market <unk>
And I discovered this was kind of fun.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun. It was not just to train the memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and a little bit of fruit glasses covered with tape -- leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could be able to do in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might serve for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment went out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice power to memorize speeches and <unk> and phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just as just tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to profit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We focus on it deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are only shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> indeed.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not going to stand up there.
But the reality is there is no shortcuts.
That's how things become <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I'm going to -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left myself to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks around our side, we are going to be so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you should be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we can just take a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old and lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that I would give to the living room.
And there were all the time watching a television room, so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, all the time I was watching myself -- and I got back to her and come back on a towel -- everyone was watching me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not safe and <unk>
I hated that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and division of areas -- but of those emotional connections, that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines it in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would call them -- they think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what you think about so based on a building built a thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional <unk> we've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We use it about 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Library of <unk> which ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this round thing -- columns, red brick -- that <unk> <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of ownership -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called mastery are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies -- new <unk> new solutions for today's life.
We were going to start and we just kind of got out and we just move away from the people.
All black, this is us, you think we think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We have to go to the other side and go back to these <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we do swing the next to back forward, over and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really really hard.
So we're approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the door again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk> them.
<unk> neon and we use bake bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we made it a skyscraper, that can be <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic erotic own.
And those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian <unk>
You may have a sign of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the door again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new <unk> design techniques -- and we found ourselves with new <unk> some forms of ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something else happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public and public and public and general in general, were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> <unk> <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew in a half a half percent when they ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> The Los Angeles, and Seattle, Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how it might be possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
They did the main mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of new millennials with other individual architects.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened to these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, it started to happen with all architecture architecture -- digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how to eat architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't look much time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before knowing whether I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement. It's 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, it starts to swing every time faster, until getting to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and they actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you can actually be in the audience.
Now we can do almost <unk> symbols with something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works, in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building which is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was a part of the community, and as the drawings looked like the exact product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and to share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building has been building today, first of the Internet in pursuit of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, about what a library can be.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell people that there are no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> and drawings complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience, and you don't support something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it by architecture.
That means that <unk> <unk> from one style to another one, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find <unk> solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, it can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical <unk> of red brick based on ideas of what it should be <unk>
This means that some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings will be transferred to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami in Miami Beach, Florida, also it can serve to make sport or <unk> or even one can marry at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East East East <unk> and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for you all to want.
Finally, we're not opposite <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings is not just reflecting our society, but they shape them up to the broader spaces, local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the step of the bathroom <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this very typical way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her picture.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it, and he asked me to think, when's a couple of doing this?
How is it that we suddenly are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it only wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because although his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
What his mom tells him and what his friends or colleagues in school are saying, you don't know who we believe.
So a video of her myself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve the thinking of them.
We talk about a regular healthy teenager and <unk> that gets these answers into one of their most productive lives of life.
Thousands of people are posting movies like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time all the time, speaking, giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way -- so young people as young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no division between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is the digitally.
What is the biggest thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news news now.
<unk> zero zero continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are comparing to.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the <unk> sport, and the singers, <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical <unk> their studies and other ways they start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls would rather do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and <unk> society and the labor development camp.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> <unk> participating in the classroom because they don't want to call attention to their physical <unk>
One in five are not attending classes at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look at good enough, specifically if you don't think that you're thin, thin, <unk> a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about it that appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it runs regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be right, of course, we're talking about how you see you, not how you are really from?"
The low self-esteem on their body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-worth do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they are involved in more diet not healthy than they can take them into a food mess of food.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at higher risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetics, aesthetics, aesthetics, sexual relations at early ages and no protection and <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview on one day in which they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would it be that banker would be.
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, you don't take it very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first one is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing that you would have the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children are not only a positive impact but also a durable impact on it.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be critical points for anyone to provide education in your body self-worth that works.
An education is a fundamental foundation, but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue, and let's be a better model to keep women and girls in our own lives.
We challenging the current status of how women are seen and said in our circles.
It's not good to count on the contribution of our <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you can see.
We all can start by doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can invite people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, "When was the last time you ever put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to truly change our culture, so our children will grow up their entire person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be those who come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never seen by being those who are, or to reach what they want to do in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two car seats -- what it would mean for her if he had liberated from that <unk> voice, on her interior, that he was unable to have a long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a <unk> <unk> feet.
What would it mean for her if we were able to do this and take the potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are moving to us all.
But let's take our children the truth.
The way you see that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
It empowers self-worth in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today will become agents of safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killing the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense <unk>
It was initially arrested for initially the innocent thing, but being prisoner for other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning on to about 12 views of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, he couldn't escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> mother teacher teacher teacher in the two made all the possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
And I saw that when people take time to interact it doesn't require a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in every human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so much to their convictions that thinks we need to use all the possible media so that everybody lived as them.
A few months before he was in the arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last end of week, he and a few friends had been going online at Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> throw <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When he touched me, my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained how to point to the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot him -- I gave her a little orange light on the goal and to surprise you, especially from me, all of the goal broke up on fire.
My uncle went back to others and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, that child.
For all, the comment was produced a lot of laughter. But only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a lot of 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot in the World Trade Tower of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I was 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability in my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable near someone -- it was time to pack and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class often was a <unk>
<unk> secret to avoid being the white thing, but to be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not developed social skills, to say <unk> to grow <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
And I love the opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put to test my thinking was during the election presidential elections.
In a <unk> program in which I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- like I had been <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done to friendship, was Jewish.
I took a few days to go out to the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend of mine, and I felt very proud to have to beat the barrier that all of life had been made me believe I was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life was taught that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
By coincidentally, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the smartest and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be a homosexual but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with the character.
In many forms he became my <unk> figure was a moment where I was desperately desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking of thinking, and she told me something that preserving my heart forever as she's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is trying to take violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I was excited about this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't come to get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved pain and the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of the terrorism victims to speak against those <unk> acts like rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you all. Thank you very much.
At this point there is a movie that projects in his minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It's got memories, as moments of your childhood you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly superimposed voice in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in straightforward.
This film is your stream of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie in it, you, you and you and you.
There's nothing to make more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are coming up to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness.
Science by nature, is an objective of an objective of it.
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience of the brain, but nobody never mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to destroy <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations anymore.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences -- but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience is going to ask some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what it was <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
It doesn't address the real core mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how the <unk> work -- how they are <unk> how to adapt and <unk> the living organisms, all of them are questions about how they work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and brain functions as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> and all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is that all the behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually, is still not a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it works for a long time, hit me against the wall against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that that was not working for reasons for us.
I think we're going to take care of this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- and so we used to this, the physics explains chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, explains biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this schema.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate in our worldview, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are at the beginning of crazy crazy before we could deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, he's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no such thing about consciousness.
All the idea of the entire subjective movie -- it includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
And actually, what you need to do, is to explain the basic functions, the behaviors of the brain, and this is what it needs to be <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just denying the observation of consciousness to be satisfying to be satisfying to it.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that we have left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
It <unk> fundamental laws that were <unk> as laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties do not explain in terms of nothing basic at all.
On the contrary, they think of first, and you build the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- the fundamental space, time, time, <unk> laws of Newton.
I think that's the situation we find out with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space space, time, cost, and then for a matter of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the awareness of the same as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it suddenly is not the object of science, either.
It opens up the path to fix scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts -- space space, time, mass, the <unk>
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the mice, the mice, the flies, even of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think "Oh, I always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some sort of raw feeling element of consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How did anybody think something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that require thinking with the physical process, is <unk> the consciousness of information.
Whenever there is information processing, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human <unk> social <unk>
<unk> of simple, simple information.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with collaborative methods.
It has a mathematical measure of integration, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And I mean <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse is a half a degree of integration, as much meaningful, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will be a level of a different awareness level.
It actually brings a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we're not talking about the reality that underlies the bottom.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision -- has the potential to celebrate our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical <unk>
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think you think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing that the answer is, yes, it's conscious.
If this is right, they do really serious ethical problems about the ethics of development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of the collective collective -- the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk. So now, we have a collective consciousness -- an internal movie for this whole set of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more secure than the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing that is a fundamental thing to be universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love it.
If we can answer these questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious consciousness theory.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're finally going to be able to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I marry my friends, I stayed with my sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to put it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a problem anymore.
She didn't really get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What does contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement.
And years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> in a high school of <unk> just after 20 minutes in the middle of the 11th studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
I said, <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things at the school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And then when I realized, this boy had had experiences with disability with disability as an inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the fault of the boy, that's true for a lot of us.
For us, ordinary people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've lied to the disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie of disability that disability is something <unk> A capital M
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may be seen one of the girl without the hands drawing with a pencil held by her mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn porn -- because we went to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we encourage the disabilities in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But what if you're that person?
I've lost the story of the number of times that have been approached strange <unk> to express that you believe that I am brave or an inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images inspired the people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough person.
So do some things.
But the things we <unk> aren't the things that you might think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I was <unk> by the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking away the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And I know I am.
It was <unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I am lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall across --  -- <unk> the ingenious trick of how to upload the cell phone battery into the battery battery.
Great.
And we learn from the strength and the resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and we get stuck.
I really believe that that lie that has sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us the hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a range of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> before a television screen will not show up the subtitles for people to <unk>
Nor do lots of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability isn't the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 10-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered <unk> of nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability we would be <unk> for rise from bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 grade in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think of <unk> actually think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for that, and people need to know about it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing the Google <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would share with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what it is to run through the <unk> of the game to 160 blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man about 110 pounds of course, trying to <unk> them with all his being.
I have been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I took some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
And unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine rising to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment. I would have a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You might have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about being in the field, but has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
You want that experience.
You want to be in the field, being your favorite players -- and they've been asked by YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get into <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you probably know you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not a cheap <unk>
And I'm going to show you why with this video.
Man: Oh. Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian roller <unk> for her life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I was <unk> a <unk> video -- crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> releasing the ball into the network?
What will be their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour, like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you would put your children's sales for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve reality <unk>
<unk> reality reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a brief refresher on the technology in the <unk>
In <unk> the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to his field of field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> of the field of field and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to his group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you take on a <unk> you won't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and you go.
And the coaches want to do it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner corner, having a view from how high people are below.
You can also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already been working.
And all that information is send to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
You've got information <unk>
This is going to take good equipment.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop being just for nerds.
It's also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field.
He <unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> usually not <unk> but the <unk> system will <unk>
It impacts the protection area.
Another <unk> you will tell you, there's an open receiver
They would take the <unk> but they were <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, though, the receptor sees in its bombsight is an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The audience is <unk> and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people, because people want to live that experience.
You want to be in the field, right?
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use only as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth of a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live being <unk>
How much is it worth of a <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than sticky notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face is all the time of us.
Thank you.
Recently I was struck after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
The majority of those 23 years ago I spent the end of the southern end of the Lofa County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure known in the world of San Francisco, from San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened up in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who wanted to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is essentially <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take it to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of you from him released you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a drop of four to five seconds, the body bumps against water about 120 miles an hour.
<unk> impact on bones, some of which we would create vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that no, they usually lie in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that we <unk> this suicide method will realize the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches parallel on the bridge.
So here is where most people are just getting away before they take their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at her life.
I want to tell you with glad that we had this day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We have come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at July 22, last year to receive a call of a suicide bomber sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I noticed Jason talking to an official of the Golden Gate bridge, <unk>
Jason was just 32 years old and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before New Jersey before New Jersey to try and suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason <unk> I said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and she left.
This is a kind and clever kid from New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had for the <unk>
<unk> damage damage to a lot of people.
I make these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it <unk>
What do you say?
So what does that mean?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you need to listen to.
Listening to understanding.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know.
You just stand there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you don't have afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
They hold the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs at <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they never go to <unk> and believe that there is nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read to you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple days ago, and it's with her permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realization that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving down to San Francisco to see the <unk> game with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police police and <unk> it as disappeared at night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car car was down in the bridge.
A witness I'd seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The Golden Gate Bridge Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the path that her son took that day, and also the value to go out ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man when I mean hope and value.
On March 11, <unk> I discussed a radio call by a possible guy on the sidewalk near the bridge near the northern tower.
I put my motorcycle on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and the next time, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for her to realize that day to go back to that lane and give her life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back to it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made it <unk> and gave her the hope and life is <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You <unk>
I didn't leave you and talk to me.
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to give you a <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the 11th of 11, and you're one of the reasons Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
He's been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly <unk>
<unk> Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We thank God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes out, <unk> when I visited San Francisco General that night, you <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I did have to do it.
Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather had poison.
That act, even though they end up their own pain, there would be an opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain to be.
Usually this is achieved just three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've said, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I left her hand at three times.
And in the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most people have said that the second one of the railing the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everybody and each of us should be able to work for doing.
<unk> can be prevent.
There is hope. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but on your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you. How do you bother that?
I have to be a unique thing in that sense, but I'm not alone -- no way I'm alone.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to go later, when I look at this photo, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the <unk> value to get rid of the limitations of skin color or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called a revelation.
This is mine.
I recorded me as a <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why would you always take that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my <unk> I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know that, really, is a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never asked myself to share my story, not because I think I'm going to be a bad thing, but because of how the world tries to be <unk>
I thank you every day.
I have mom, dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of the <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a beauty <unk> pageant.
That night she said, "Why haven't you ever involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and I was a third finalist between over 40 Harbor.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was to queen of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called it and said, "You know if you beat the United States and you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand, perform the most sophisticated surgery more sophisticated and secure.
At that time in the U.S., we need to have surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving driver's license, and the gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or power to get a <unk> but for me it was a license for living to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but <unk> he ended his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 percent of November we do a global certainty by <unk> <unk>
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, I am coming out of the closet.
I can't follow my truth and only for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that some day no longer has been more than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. First of all, thank you with all my <unk>
My parents' network to my parents especially, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and they told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, I would take the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that TED assignment, and that there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask them questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by education defending his rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> their efforts in 2011, and the <unk> the National National Prize, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when birth was born, her birth was not <unk>
It's not welcome by his father, nor for his mother.
The neighborhood comes back, he gives her the mother to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was going to be a long way to have a child.
When it comes to the first child, the first child, the first daughter, gets to sad.
When it comes to the second daughter, you get married, and with the hope of a child, when she <unk> her third daughter, she feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the human mother, but the daughter -- <unk> daughter when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home and the school could be home to her brothers.
Up to the age of 12 years in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it goes through 13 years, you have to get out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of her father and his brothers and her family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that idea honor, the could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this idea of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of course.
And there's one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl should be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
That's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts the choices of their father and her mother and people's decisions and even if you don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like whether or if he <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, he has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens in the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like <unk> to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And a lot before I was thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I put a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when I was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention the journey of a girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One presentation to school means that has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations of where it can explore their potential for its future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian and I was in the relative part of the family, couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why value for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I sat it down to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on her personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys for the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned from going to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised up in the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, he offered her herself for the New York Times, and talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and 30 o'clock in October 2012, he was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell him to my wife and "I must love him for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't bother you.
You know, the fair cause.
<unk> your life in the cause of the truth, because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot to me, and I couldn't ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that would spread through my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give you good. Please don't be <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't run his job.
You fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's in my <unk> that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you cling to a brain operation.
You're still just as smart or not?
If you might not be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, from over a dozen chemical powerful every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of chemicals and chemicals and try to deal with them for life.
I've been saved by a little bit of saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided I was going to try and get the <unk> dose, because there is actually no clear map that tells you in <unk>
I started to test with different <unk> and I was amazed by how to see how little changes in the dose would dramatically have my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I had been able to get doses of typical <unk> for a man in Tennessee, and I was surprised to see how I would see my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several types of guys like this, or maybe some versions of them.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was able to do so much <unk> a problem that I had in the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to do is, I've got better with men.
What I tried to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my thinking about, my creative thinking of ideas.
It was almost always in images, and that became my point of key <unk> how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were able to build new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the brain works, to me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to thinking and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images out of my mind to the computer screen screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination only to lead to the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could take the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people have creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image functional resonance -- to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain from that same individual while you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left, and you see the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeating in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they put their brains to create a large pool of the brain reactions to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new animals, and as long as you get a new <unk>
The computer -- using just the brain information on the scan of the scanning scanning -- to show what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up us.
We're good at doing that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This has been conducted with the brain scan systems that are available today, and their resolution has increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even me, <unk> with the recent MRI result -- first we need to ask, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, extraordinary magnets are only providing little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea, rather than larger, make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different ones, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make these really big magnets, right?
However, most recent advances in recent advances in <unk> of clever and bright solutions on <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> radio <unk> in MRI systems.
At their time, instead of a magnetic field, they would be able to collect magnetic patterns <unk> <unk> to radio frequencies.
So when you combine the magnetic patterns with the <unk> radio processing patterns we can dramatically increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split into layers our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood of the blood -- but the <unk> and <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even direct neural activity.
We will be able to put our ideas in direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go on top of the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be compelling use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few choices to open this door.
So anyway, pick up a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet alone.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet maybe to tell you some person for the first time that love or saying to someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have ever done in life.
And so I think I was a hard conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet something universal.
It's not fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side Side -- I worked in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, but I didn't think the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope of that because of my pants pants and I got my head down, I would ask you to usually ask me a kid to say, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would appear a awkward silence, at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look his son.
But I would not say anything, I would go on the inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
So that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready to get into the female issues on the table.  I had the <unk> of Betty <unk>
Gloria <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And then he took a deep breath, and I went down the look and my backs a four year-old girl with a pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "Are you <unk>
And so he took a deep breath, and I got out of <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw <unk> <unk> but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Because I'm more of the kind of girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all right. "Oh, good. You're a girl.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the most easy conversation ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both went <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I have lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls are.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
You know, I'll give you a hundred reasons why I was going to get out of my closet more difficult to get out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who have declared online bank is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than saying to your five-year-old who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to do with respect to how difficult it is difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, that I had a horse tail, a <unk> <unk>
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight against any <unk> who would go to coffee.
I was frozen for fear -- <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> gay, and the moving only one muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers who I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around in purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade <unk> was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of those guests knew that I was gay, and in making my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after I'm going to talk a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what's your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> <unk> and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us.
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting for desperately to show your support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk> shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic it is.
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anybody with whom I <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl Of <unk>
Now, please see this through the <unk> perspective -- but understand that what it means to go out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
You get the <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in coffee didn't have armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other you need to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk>
If you know they're gay, you know?
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of them can go hurt safe hurt by what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's something in them.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen a very productive example of <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of this machine is as interesting as the question of whether an submersible can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the pioneers of computing like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we took a program to try to understand the underlying fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Go back a walk.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that it's an alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth and the Earth of Earth <unk> but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't have any concept on Earth intelligence on Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some time in time, the asteroids that we prescribe the surface of a <unk> planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, I think, to a unique mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be slowing down, adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, to development of universal states that will increase the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them for already several years ago: there is a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible futures accessible, yes, to an impending time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep an open choice.
And so having this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Do you accept the level of the human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video I'm thinking, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to conditions more favorable than intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy.
What if intelligent behavior isn't only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you find in.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple animal tests -- play games, and even making money <unk> actions, and they even make money <unk> actions, and all of it had been accurate to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically -- automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance that balance is going to have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This capacity for tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Furthermore, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling aside opposite opposite sides at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see them successfully play a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly falling down, and keep successful the very connected network.
This same network of network network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we look at <unk> we organize the routes of a fleet of boats, finding out with success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we look at <unk> spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of actions, and successfully increase the assets under their exponentially.
This risk skill skill will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of three-dimensional cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term -- robot, the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you were able to get smart, smart machines, there would be a rebellion <unk>
Machines <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we have had the whole concept of rebellion in reverse.
It's not that machines become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all other contrast, that the impulse to take control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out directly from taking control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
They often ask, how do you look for targets you learn from these kinds of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, the intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a tipping point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and to lose the planet that we call <unk>
By the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is just one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that is measured by the faint <unk> of stars when the planets go down in front of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that will get us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
And together, it helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, was the hottest place.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since millennia, now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist and no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newborn planet and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> as the <unk> tracks their surface to look for clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now offering not just short flight flights but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But despite all of these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places with Mars.
Even in the lowest and highest places on Earth, air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets to push down a big, sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
As much as I like to look like space exploration, I'm deep to disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to give humanity is as you imagine that the captain of the Titanic is going to have place later on the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for climate exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
<unk> environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
So let me leave you with an experiment called the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, having in mind that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that will build this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> and the <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to deal with the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the very easiest task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I was going to put my own home.
And as I was on the front porch by looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table where I had <unk> them.
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and all they were very cool.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, I could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I got my <unk> and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure they don't more expensive than an <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought, although in the circumstances, the circumstances was well like that.
I'm a neurologist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases cardiac rhythm -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and adrenaline levels, the thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in your place, which was going to put bad things out there.
Or at least if you happen, bad things are going to give you the chance that it's a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about it, but until one month later, my thoughts are not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked about the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared my passport, I had been practicing something called <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong -- right?
In the <unk> as it explains you to go ahead and try and find out all the things that you could go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things going on or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with <unk>
And in the house, you put a place for the things that you lose easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the same is right, where the fish are the fish, which places <unk> trees live in, where tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that enables you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find your nuts.
They were not using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move so much.
This is the reason to lose your car keys, reading and <unk>
So at home, I would put a place for the keys, a hook along the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you look at a place and they're <unk> with that stuff that you will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card card cards, your drive, passport, <unk> yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of it made of medical decisions, and in fact to make financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you need to take from whatever would benefit from a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that the high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, attack, a <unk>
So you're thinking that having the tall cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've already heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you probably know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do so, a statistic that you should be asking for the most doctors don't want to talk, and the drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or having surgery on any medical procedure before you help a person.
And should you think about what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me anything if not to help me.
But really, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault -- it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood so well the mechanisms are <unk>
But estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This by the cynical research research research <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the medicine for a year before they avoid one of the heart attack, a cerebral <unk> or another <unk>
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 from <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask yourself for a more statistic and it is, <unk> from <unk>
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, even if you take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think of how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the reasoning chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people who have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug to help you for the drug.
I don't say they should or don't take the <unk>
I just say they need to have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> medical ethic is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to initiate the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value value, but actually this necessary number you need to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the biggest men of 50, prostate prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of them just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice for a lot of times, they want a shorter life on pain, or a longer life that could have much pain in the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change your opinion in the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> <unk> and one of the things that happens at that point is that they turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face <unk> with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism into those things, it's not very quickly. You could get the lunch lunch -- so nothing matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational sense of rational thought, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to take care of the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be able to be able to put the systems into the place that will help to minimize damage, or to prevent things bad at bad things in the first place.
<unk> the snow evening in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor installed a little combination next to the door, with a key to the entry door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I've never seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite piece.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the score, you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> and you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can ever be a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade of 1800, and over time, mixed with local marks, and the language has been mixed with the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country -- following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms, no <unk>
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example here.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise in eating the bag of <unk> <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't get the covered in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the more sound label than the average person does it.
I'm so <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
It was going to be going on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, I'll be with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At the time, the sound was the trend and that struck me by <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Does it go to me more than art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel that <unk> or experience it visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my art practice.
And all they had taught me as soon as to sound, I decided to leave it and let it go.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt like the sound was <unk> it was a little listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to go to me and my art job, or I could tell you.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eye of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me equally and become my voice.
So I'm able to be able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers in <unk>
And their voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value that is like taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I won't continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to do it in the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic environment, you would focus on the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> <unk> in a lot of different <unk> parameters are <unk>
If you plot a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the speed, the shape of the body -- the speed, the way the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you would get <unk> just a button at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in a way to express a concept of clear or idea in <unk>
If only a button would change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning completely differently.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters -- <unk> can be expressing different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lenses of the music?
If I had to create a sign and it would take it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun, and you put it into it.
This is all the day."
If you put it up and <unk> the speed speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel like the same thing can be said.
All the <unk>
This is all night on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time in <unk> and how the distance to body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea at the same time, <unk> it again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically I would automatically do in <unk>
Look at <unk> right -- right -- left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of them with high hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in your head as the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this: Please do it over again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please take it again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how three signs are very similar. Everyone is in your head and chest -- but they make very different meanings on your head.
It's incredible to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very specific world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have it automatically automatically has social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> I don't have to hear a lot to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I'd like to give you your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents would say, "You can do it all, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or a ignorance bubble -- I should say, because adults would lie to protect us from the horrible truth.
And when I got older, I found out that adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good at clean one of others.
The country, now I'm an adult and teach the invention in the Hong Kong of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships ships and networks, those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and we <unk> them and put this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it's also very risky to use those huge boats as well.
So together with my students, six to 15 years old, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of <unk> labor so that the kids very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something that we hope it works.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, only information <unk>
By the use of a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children are getting sick with the robots.
And then we actually create what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned and web camera and web cameras, and they put it into a floating robot, which is slowly moving through the water and for the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a measure of the amount of plastic in the water.
I would take this invention of step into a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will be <unk>
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to solve it immediately.
I can investigate my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, the Internet, the Internet, and you get distracted by this one.
A child, perhaps lower than 10 years, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the world's <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is going to take place where water live.
You can also see that the water is brown -- the mud and the oil are also brown color and when it's <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can lead through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe I might address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and probably remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear pool nearby to water.
And today, according to the reports by 300 tons of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation is gone from the Japanese coast -- and the majority, at the moment, is that it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, the Earth, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we go to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the <unk> <unk> map to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this we could notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized a civil expedition the closest to the middle central to date.
We zoom in to 1.5 miles of nuclear, and with the fishermen help in the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a remote problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, and also with very simple open-source technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit like so long, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we convert it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal, metal -- a little bit of biology, of optical fibers, can be built almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced population transforming their standard wheels into new <unk>
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, creators, <unk> <unk> we need to prepare the next generation for the environment and the people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two Abu <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one of a silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing we believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the raw, he saw a figure that fights for being free.
<unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information for every cell to work and to get it in.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production in mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world which is made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects like <unk> of different parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with light-activated pores here.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like the filter -- the other primarily as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that changes gradually its functionality through variation.
Here's a split screen that represents my view of every single designer and an architect to work today between the <unk> and the gene, of the machine and the organism, between the assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right and the law, and synthetic is shown in two screens after me.
My work at the simplest level, it is about bringing these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and getting up to growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why wasn't it possible about this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment -- where four disciplines that offers access access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
Are we designing objects, products, structures and tools through scales, in a scale of 24 meters in diameter and the tools of diameter with a fair basis that someday not very far print buildings and graphics at the nanoscale made by genetically modified buildings, which are glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> an archetype of the former Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is size to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion fashion fashion -- it's like a second skin made out of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around her waist.
<unk> with 3D printing with 3D printing -- we print this layer and 3D <unk> with the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical analytical and <unk> instruments that allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the time, comfortable <unk> and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, we went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> surface pattern becomes <unk>
It <unk> this <unk> surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, changes its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother tells me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and really define a lot of what it matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> tree.
For that first tree, it would have no difference between the trunk, the leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made the trees grow up trees with branches and <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would it be like if the objects were made of a single part?
Would you go to a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material to put together the kind of material of the <unk> tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million metric tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune in their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked them a bunch of seed <unk> <unk> and collected <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built up a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a <unk> material long, 100 percent recyclable life.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves dry to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to hold <unk> <unk> that first came up on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, they <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture very quickly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems on <unk> and if it grows even more than window.
A <unk> tree, <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of shrimp seed in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects that are designed for <unk> <unk> <unk> life and put it on the ground, they will help rise a tree.
The match for our next exploration use the same design principles was the solar system.
We were looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- and then they would add new biological functionalities into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, they were <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns into sugar, the other <unk> sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help you build these bacteria and to make their function <unk>
So we begin to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material as the potential <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we get more transparent.
This gut system <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it goes on 60 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our very very <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside her clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> our skin <unk> our skin tissue -- the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
Now you know a 3D printer prints material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture in which it was <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like a structure, the other is the glue, or the matrix, which is <unk> those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first turn into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to put a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
At the end of understanding better how this complex process works, we glue a tiny magnet on the head of a silk worm <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they would take a foreground, and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different systems, different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates can shape the raw silk without boiling a boiling silk alone.
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms to wider and more dark and <unk> and so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the ray of light and heat and distributed silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked them to <unk> silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to deal with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again like us, but much, much shorter as we short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk about the silk <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a two material ecology, the designers must bring these two visions in the world.
What it takes to us, of course, the beginning.
Here's a new design era, a new era of creation, which leads us from a design inspired by nature inspired by nature inspired by the first time, which demands us for the first time, make us care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can touch it with your fingers.
Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I was like English, the <unk> and the art and online websites -- in addition, playing the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, because I have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I went back to something else, something completely different, and I got myself excited about it, and I was going to absorb and feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to pick one thing, denying all my other passions and I would encourage you to <unk>
Another reason why caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was worried about engagement, or to be overwhelmed or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you about then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> has learned from culture.
We ask first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they <unk> that age.
It's considered a naive matter to create nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
It was <unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is over and over again as we grow various different forms, <unk> <unk> to high school students who are going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before the dream of the sleep.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream about what they might be, it's not inspired by dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you, what do you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though <unk> <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of journal turned into <unk> <unk> and a creative teacher.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear about is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do with your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that show your curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And you feel something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
It's a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of creative interests.
Is it a little <unk>
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
It <unk> whatever you like or <unk> yourself in your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapting to a community, we cannot agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths as being this way.
Here's three superpowers -- <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> her shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, and travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by her <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
From the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> we become interested by something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to try and get out of our comfort areas.
Many of the skills are <unk> to other disciplines, we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we need, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and independent <unk>
As a child pianist <unk> an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk> you know.
Before to become a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their practices and this ability to write compelling gains for editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you would have even if at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, thousands of pages of website, sometimes a consultant of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes when it appears James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine, Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, which they really need to do.
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if they're pushed to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
<unk> of belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
A specialist can dive into depth and put together ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should be designing life and careers that will connect to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them are being told to be more like their fellow <unk>
And once I said this, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist then <unk> for all the media.
That's where you give the best to do.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just noticed being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
Let's get the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately he passed away in <unk>
After his death, she did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy that had never seen before.
The even more surprising thing.
If you could have been alive today, we couldn't give it to her more help than she <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
<unk> antibiotics have been discovered and vaccines to protect us from <unk> lots of treatments for breast cancer, for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been made progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the chances of Alzheimer's to be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend your years from Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or being wanted Alzheimer's disease.
Just in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs to increase in five times in 2050, 2050, as the generation of the world's <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively recently to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't be able to cure or even slow down.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that we get more Alzheimer's and cause a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years -- all of the last few years -- all of the time, scientists, passive <unk> with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy human brain compared to the <unk> patient.
In addition to creating a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's increases life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that it folds up as an origami.
There are places on the paper that they're <unk>
And when it folds out, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> spots are left outside.
This makes the protein molecules that are <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, in its most recently, the wires have been reduced and waited for the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, <unk> engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when these drugs were <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These are, on the other hand, they have protein molecules that they stick in each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but the research like this sample that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to think about Alzheimer's that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to conquer cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not mostly a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
To love with somebody, you do this.
The article comes from a psychological study that was designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when you try it back one last summer night.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers will be <unk> to make 36 questions, and then both more personal questions, and then you both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number two: When was the last time you ever heard another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like him or her or her, I know very quick, this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me with the attention that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we had <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column that I send to the column that I sent to the column later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, keep in my way to still yet?
And the reason I think you challenge this is because they've made me already this question again and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, and so I had asked myself to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand views.
And that has a good burden of attention to a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was published on Friday at night, and then the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I've already called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was like, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing that about own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or the people who did every day for weeks, they were always, first the same question: They still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search on the mailbox in my email with the phrase: <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the breadth of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times was published a <unk> article for San <unk> which included the experiences of readers when we test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
I looked at TV interviews, and I would encourage the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons I was afraid of the <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked on, they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce <unk> love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, most of all, people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and then <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less that interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the research goal was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing that, and the later number of studies were also used by <unk> protocol -- as a fast way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of police and community -- and they've used it among people in the world of opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me to <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He looked <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to tell you about the person with whom I <unk>
Well, he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> I know they managed to get better known to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking at when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, which was mostly my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I turned to science.
And so I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a certain way <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I was just talking about the book I would write but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was overwhelmed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel so bad.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand than I believe.
But I can also see more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more of what reasonably can demand me to me.
So what I'm looking for love is an assurance -- not only to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to keep being <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people wanted when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media said about 36 questions is there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to mitigate some of the risk <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because fall in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that asks, still follow together?
And their content with an answer of Yes/No.
So more than a question, I want you to ask more questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love, and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love with when things go together, and how to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that is inevitably leads to a relations or even more, how do you live in the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more controversial conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same as to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love happened.
<unk> fell in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at the reading right now, not because it wasn't true, but because at the moment, there was no idea what that choice was supposed to.
I didn't think how many times we would have both of them to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always choice or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and said, 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous, kind of fun, and having expressed that choice in the largest U.S. newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I'm going to do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to be the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is a chance to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian <unk> and in a certain way I got a <unk> of the forest.
New York City makes a while.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some weird humanoid or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our sort of <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has a grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go to tour and get to <unk> and all of those <unk> things and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> I was <unk> to Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has fear of the bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite of it, somehow it seemed that it grew size, as if it was that you have the text with a <unk>
So I built it more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs -- strange bottles that I would find around the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing the same as you get around a body in the crime scene.
And I took out the objects and I created my own <unk>
First of all, you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I get stuck.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window and another window, and he had all these windows together and make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this would actually work, and I could stop using it.
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> inspired me in a big measure in "The garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's got <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, in this <unk> <unk> where it was <unk>
So here is where the heads of animals are heading to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand is coming out of clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little narrative.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, it spits up clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> a tail tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, her tail turn into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made of punch cards.
They have <unk> them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a human form and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope, of microscope that weighs 1.3 billion pounds with a human trapped inside.
This is a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, and you get the entrance to it.
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and he covers your penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's some pills coming out and enter the head of this strange statue coming in.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a student, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world -- and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people inside it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's living in.
And together we came to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start doing those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has an effect against pain, first of the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any drug <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they use the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the replacement cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects -- in their most negative, because in the time that you get to the <unk> they will be <unk> and worse for the time that it takes to get to their destination, which is where it's most important, in the HIV camp.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients who were engaged in regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with today's drugs that are a long-term treatment run by the oral <unk>
One day, I felt and I thought, "You know, make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and surgery of diabetes -- you can use it for anything that is <unk> including transportation transport of medicines.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open up or drill extremely small, open holes that open and close down, almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
Do you want to ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and laser beam on the mobile cell membrane as that these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology, but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is moving to the site.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of the infection, while the laser uses again to keep the open cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it has success, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups -- <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot shoot down.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to violent <unk>
I do business work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they make it do, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and the policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also set up a political party -- a social services network and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking now.
<unk> a complex communication machinery stations radio TV TV websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising fundraising <unk> but by doing business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't secure and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be understood by the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price unbearably unbearably for the population.
But in general, providing social services means fill in an empty <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election election of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledge the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid groups.
<unk> because they fill together gaps in government, and emerge like armed and political groups, involved in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated them are these organizations, we can less <unk> as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, and run all of the <unk> collect the trash system running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak are states, like in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to be investing more in military tools.
<unk> that government of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important also to establish and put the peace.
If we can better understand groups -- we understand better than what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to non-violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors may not win the military power to win some fights, but we won't give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safe vacuum of safety that enabled these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I fear that accepting the <unk> tag would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I got a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> the sex -- as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women treat women and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> who might be a feminist.
It will labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty word.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much with high self-worth and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that <unk> woman until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as we were going to <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, and no need for <unk> controls or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have in account of our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality -- social condition, skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how do we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the job, I listen to rap music -- rap for all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me the classic <unk> classic <unk> of yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk> t-shirt.
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you gave you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical speech.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion journals and real things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> fairy tales, which make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's her choice, and I am not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I know that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes financially vulnerable through this very choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women in color, the <unk> and the gay workers and <unk> for white, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist here.
As a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk>
We hope that it will be perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to be <unk> from that <unk> before trying to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders, they are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a <unk> fear of what it means to be that <unk> fear of not being able to fulfill the slightly realistic expectations.
Take an example to <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music of 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk> to see this pop star embrace and to know women and men and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started hard arguments if <unk> was or not just a feminist.
It <unk> your feminism, instead of just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go much further from the sane and <unk> criticism to address feminism of any woman, <unk> until it wasn't left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question of feminism, or rather, one feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists won't change their way to talk about women in their songs until they redefined changing affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has her music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a better choice.
But when the bad decisions justify this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
These are two little girls and <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
And they get rid of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sport, <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies don't treat women more than such as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers as popcorn.
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, engaging in his project, or to work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people in the world.
Those of us who are <unk> but forcing them to participate in this kind of projects, we can also adapt to being included until more like us to be <unk> to overcome barriers to decision jobs.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will go to the end, the people in the power and cinema producers and music and music, <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also say to bravery our feminism, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist won't be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started believing that was nothing.
I took my voice, and after everything I didn't bother believing I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
And I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understand what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, I spent children in California had been <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things in this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most important diseases that are <unk>
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that broke mortality on autism and <unk> vaccines and disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rising estimates of autism in time.
For the most 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians that I had heard about it creating all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence estimates continued stable only three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> healthcare organizations like <unk> <unk> are routinely routinely referred to autism as an HIV epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you don't vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from Disease Control Disease Control what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and "A better <unk> detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language is not <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks in the face of her son of two years, visual contact.
If the criteria criteria had to figure out why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
Over the most part of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a children's psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital <unk> <unk> <unk> the article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be <unk> private, private, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving hands on their faces, but they were prey to panic by <unk> as when he did not put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in his clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as main authority of the world in the subject, stated that I'd seen less than 150 real cases of its own syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, we were going to give that diagnosis to <unk> but we now know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had turned to nine out of 10 children sent out for other doctors to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> the autism as a form of uranium was caused by cold, cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, you have kept it carefully in a fridge that you don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before it turned to the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records he said, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like kids were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents who were desperate to win their approval approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own fine, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of welfare mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and warm people, and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl in a little girl with no support, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up to the National Service, for Health who had more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try and find autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in a diverse way.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit a beautiful <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever noticed about these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article about the competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no even one translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German -- and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for children with learning learning were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in her clinic started with music classes with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability of life that required <unk> <unk> spaces during the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, having to call them their little teachers, and he was devoted to helping the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
And what autism has seen was the autism as a diverse continuum that included a staggering variety of bribes, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were <unk> and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continued <unk> in <unk> culture as a awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that would reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> by one wide and delivery model.
These changes didn't fell into broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between a bunch of <unk> to reform these people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
And before I went out to come out with <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> of experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that the people with autism and their families will finally support support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics.
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in America are the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk>
In the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to refuse the idea that these new puzzles are going to solve for new breakthroughs -- doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to details.
Indeed, people are autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most gender aspects of autism are found on understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and the parents with faith in their children.
One autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck to get the boat off the <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to afford a brain.
Thank you.
